**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** 

1. **Introduction** 

In June 2012, the Federal Minister for Agriculture and Irrigation and for Livestock, Fisheries and Rangelands, on behalf of the Government of Sudan and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Representative in Sudan, signed the “Country Programming Framework (CPF) for the Republic of Sudan (2012- 2016)”. The CPF is a “roadmap” for FAO-Sudan to support the Federal Ministries of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI)  of  Livestock,  Fisheries  and  Rangelands  (MoLFR)  and  of  Environment,  Forestry  and  Physical Development (MoEFPD), and the Government of Sudan at large, in the improvement of food security, reduction of  rural  poverty,  sustainable  management  of  natural  resources  and  overall  development  of  the  country’s agriculture sector. 

Between September and November 2014, FAO-Sudan and the Government of Sudan undertook a “mid-term review” to  update  and  revise  the  CPF.  This  has  been  necessary because of  its  unclear  alignment  with  the evolving country situation (with regard  to  changes  in  Government policy  following the  secession of  South Sudan and the subsequent loss of oil revenues and downturn in Sudan’s economy), inherent lack of synergies and integration between development and emergency interventions and the need for a more resilience focus, lack of resource mobilization and communication strategies and a need to further prioritize the outcomes and outputs of the Framework, given its broad range of priority actions (*viz a viz* FAO’s comparative advantage in Sudan). 

As part of the CPF mid-term review process, FAO developed a resilience-focused action plan to operationalize the Framework. The resultant CPF Plan of Action (PoA) for Sudan was prepared on the basis of a detailed review of existing strategy documents and close consultations with decision makers of concerned Government ministries,  civil  society  and  private  sector  organizations  and  policy  and  technical  officers  of  the  FAO Representation in Sudan and its programmes and projects – taking into account the priorities and interventions of MoAI, MoLFR, MoEFPD and their development partners, to ensure synergies and co mplementarities. 

2. **Situation Analysis** 
1. **The Rural Setting** 

Agriculture is important to Sudan’s economy given that: 

- The total population of Sudan is 36.2 million; of which two-thirds live in rural areas. 
- The national poverty rate is 47 percent; but 58 percent of the population are “poor” in rural areas. 
- 3.9 million people are food insecure (November/December 2014 IPC Report). 
- Agriculture accounts for nearly one-third of the national Gross Domestic Product. 
- Nearly half of the national workforce is engaged in agriculture (i.e. crop, livestock, fisheries and forestry production) and agroprocessing industries. 
2. **Challenges to the Agriculture Sector** 

Given the decline of agricultural growth over the past two decades and the secession of South Sudan in 2011, with its loss of oil revenues and subsequent downturn in the country’s economy, the strengths and weaknesses of Sudan’s agriculture sector could be interpreted as reflecting the need for: 

- Development of technical and functional capacity for policy and planning. 
- Enhancement of agriculture productivity and production. 
- Increasing public and private sector agricultural research and development. 
- Reforming land tenure and land-use systems. 
- Improvement of data collection and analysis for food and nutrition security. 
- Public  and  private  investment  in  rural  infrastructure,  e.g.  irrigation  systems,  slaughterhouses, agroprocessing facilities and markets. 
- Rehabilitation of rangelands (i.e. pastures and water supplies) and facilitation of fair resource sharing. 
- Increasing monitoring and provision of veterinary services for better transboundary animal disease outbreak management. 
- Expanding disaster risk management to include challenges arising from climate change.

3. **Opportunities for Agricultural Development** 

The potential opportunities of the Sudanese agriculture sector have remained unchanged for decades, but recent liberalization of some agricultural commodities and increasing income-creation opportunities for smallholders through the recognition of producer organizations and improving food and nutrition security information flows, knowledge management and policy development have enhanced many of the opportunities listed as follows: 

- Rich natural resource base: 
  - 175 million *feddans1* (74 million ha) of unused cultivable land; 
  - 90-120 million heads of animals; 
  - marine and freshwater fisheries resources; 
  - underground and surface water supplies; and 
  - biodiversity and genetic pool. 
- Large yield gap between research centres and farms provides a large potential to increase agricultural production. 
- Good prospects for reducing post-harvest losses and adding value in key agricultural products for improving incomes and diet diversity/food-based nutrition of rural households and increasing exports. 
- Close proximity to important markets, i.e. COMMESA, Middle East, Gulf states, Europe, etc. 
- Great potential to increase inflow of foreign direct investment. 
3. **FAO’s Approach to Sustainable Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition** 
1. **FAO’s Strategic Objectives** 

In order to achieve its Vision of a “*world free of hunger and malnutrition and improved living standards”*, FAO has defined five Strategic Objectives (SOs), namely: 

SO1 – Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. 

SO2 – Increase and improve provision of goods and services from agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a sustainable manner. 

SO3 – Reduce rural poverty. 

SO4 – Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems at local, national and international levels. 

SO5 – Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises. 

2. **FAO’s Regional Initiatives** 

In 2014, FAO’s Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa (RNE) defined three Regional Initiatives in order to support the national policies and programmes of member countries, such as Sudan, through the delivery of products and services from across the results frameworks of FAO’s five Strategic Objectives in an integrated and coordinated manner, namely: 

1. Sustainable small-scale agriculture for inclusive development. 
1. Building resilience to enhance food security and nutrition. 
1. Water scarcity. 
3. **FAO’s Good Practices in Sudan’s Agriculture Sector** 

Several good practices have been tested and validated by the actors and beneficiaries of FAO’s humanitarian relief,  livelihood  protection/recovery and  agricultural  development  programmes  and  projects  over  the  past decade  and  are  recommended  for  replication  and  upscaling  by  Government  agencies  and  civil  society organizations (CSOs) and  for  sharing and adoption by greater numbers of smallholder farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk and tree-dependent communities under interventions proposed   for the CPF/PoA for Sudan. These include: 

- Capacity development of government institutions and CSOs. 
- Food security information systems for food security decision making and policy development. 
- Control of transboundary plant and animal pests and diseases. 
- Community-based animal resources development services. 
- Farmer field school group-based approach to adaptive research and participatory extension. ![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.004.png)

- Community-based natural resource management. 
- Water harvesting and on-farm water management. 
- Post-harvest management, as part of the integrated value chain approach. 
- Voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land in the context of food security (VGGT). 
- Resource mobilization, implementation and operations for emergency relief food security and livelihood protection interventions. 
4. **Plan of Action – Framework** 
1. **Goal** 

The overall goal of the PoA for Sudan is “to contribute to the improvement of food security and nutrition and the  reduction of rural poverty in Sudan,  while supporting the  country’s longer-term economic development goals”. In this context, the PoA is in line with the Government of Sudan’s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper; Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) Pillars 1 and 2 and FAO’s five global Strategic Objectives. 

2. **Objective** 

The objective of PoA for Sudan is “to address the key challenges of food insecurity, malnutrition and rural poverty in hazard-prone areas of Sudan by strengthening the resilience of vulnerable smallholders through a cohesive   programme   supporting   relevant   household   livelihood-protection  and   recovery,   equitable   and sustainable management of natural resources and agriculture development initiatives”. In this context, the PoA is in line with the Government of Sudan’s Second National Five-Year Strategic Development Plan (2012-2016) and Agricultural Revival Programme (2008-2014) and FAO’s three Regional Initiatives, and is in common with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)-led “Sudan Country Programming Paper – To End Drought Emergencies in the Horn of Africa” and the Darfur Regional Authority’s Darfur Development Strategy. 

The PoA therefore aims to increase food availability and accessibility and diversify household incomes in order to decrease the risk of threats and crises faced by landless, marginal and small-scale men and women farmers over the extended period of the CPF (2015-2019). Moreover, the PoA prioritizes and promotes interrelated and mutually supporting and sustainable short-, medium- and long-term interventions at all levels (i.e. household, community  and  institutional)  that  would  ultimately  contribute  to  overcoming  the  underlying  causes  of vulnerability in Sudan. 

3. **Timelines for PoA Intervention Areas** 

The PoA for Sudan has a duration of five years (2015-2019) and is spread across three overlapping/interlocking tracks/timeframes, namely: 

1. Rapid-delivery and immediate-impact food and nutrition security and livelihood protection and short- term risk-sensitive agricultural policy/strategy development (*12 to 24 months*). 
1. Medium-term  delivery  and  impact  for  risk-sensitive  research  and  development  and  institutional strengthening of the agriculture sector (*24 to 48 months*). 
1. Long-term delivery and impact for rural livelihoods recovery and risk-sensitive agricultural and rural development (*36 to 60 months*). 
4. **Intervention Areas** 

The CPF/PoA for Sudan identifies four strategic intervention areas that mutually reinforce 17 short-, medium- and  long-term  overlapping/interlocking  projects  and  programmes  in  support  of  the  relief,  recovery  and development of Sudan’s small-scale agriculture sector, namely: 

1. Improved   policy   and   institutional   environment   for   food   and   nutrition   security   and   resilience programming  –  through  capacity  development,  enhanced  coordination  and  better-informed  decision making and knowledge management and sharing systems (four short-term projects, one medium-term project and two long-term programmes). 
1. Enhancing production, productivity and competitiveness of the crops, livestock and forestry subsectors and agricultural climate change adaptation (CCA) (two short-term projects, one medium-term project and one long-term programme). 

ix 

3. Natural  resource  management and  livelihoods,  food  security  and  nutrition  response,  protection and recovery (one medium-term project and three long-term programmes). 
3. National,  regional  and  international  control  of  threats  to  Sudanese  food  chains  (two  medium-term projects). 

The PoA also includes the integration of seven ongoing FAO-implemented projects due for completion in 2015 and 2016 and five pipeline projects due for startup in 2015.

1\. INTRODUCTION

![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.005.jpeg)



1. **INTRODUCTION** 

Since  2011  and  the  succession  of  South  Sudan  and  a  downturn  in  the  Sudanese  economy,  the Government of Sudan has advocated agriculture as the engine to effectively contribute to economic growth and export performance and to simultaneously advance people’s livelihoods, reduce poverty, improve food security and nutrition and develop and protect natural resources (*as advocated in the Second  Phase  of  the  Agricultural  Revival  Programme  [2012-2014]  and  the  Darfur  Development Strategy 2013-2019*). However, the genuine needs of Sudan’s agriculture sector, and the role of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in supporting the Government in addressing  those  needs,  are  not  totally  reflected  in  the  United  Nations  Development  Assistance Framework  (UNDAF)  (2013-2016)  nor  in  the  Organization’s  own  priority  areas  for  its  “Country Programming Framework (CPF)” for Sudan (2012-2016). 

On 5 June 2012, the Federal Ministers of Agriculture and Irrigation and of Livestock Fisheries and Rangeland, on behalf of the Government of Sudan, and the FAO Representative in Sudan signed the “CPF for the Republic of Sudan (2012-2016)”. The CPF is a “roadmap” for FAO Sudan to support the Ministries of Agriculture and Irrigation (MoAI), of Livestock, Fisheries and Rangelands (MoLFR) and of Environment, Forestry and Physical Development (MoEFPD) and the Government of Sudan at large in the improvement of food security, reduction of rural poverty, sustainable management of natural resources and overall development of the country’s agriculture sector (Section 4.1.3). 

In June 2013 – in response to adoption of the “Developing Darfur: a Reconstruction and Recovery Strategy (DDS)” by the Government of Sudan and the United Nations – FAO prepared a “Darfur Agricultural  Recovery,  Reconstruction  and  Development  Programme”  to  address  agriculture  and natural  resources-related  objectives  and  outputs  of  DDS’s  three  pillars,  namely:  (i)  Governance, Justice and Reconciliation; (ii) Reconstruction; and (iii) Economic Recovery. The programme was prepared  in  cooperation  with  the  Darfur  Regional  Authority,  State  Ministries  of  Agriculture  and United Nations agencies and NGOs operating in the Darfur region. The total cost of short-, medium- and long-term resilience-focused interventions of the six-year programme is USD 146.4 million. To date, FAO has mobilized USD 9.7 million for short-term interventions in “food and nutrition security restoration and strengthening and livelihood resilience”, with USD 2.7 million further available in a “hard” pipeline. 

In February 2014, the FAO Regional Conference for the Near East and North Africa Region adopted three Regional Initiatives prepared by the Organization’s Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa  (RNE):  “Sustainable  Small-scale  Agriculture”,  “Water  Scarcity”  and  “Resilience  for  Food Security and Nutrition”. The Conference also called upon Sudan to act as a model country for piloting actions under these initiatives. 

Between September and November 2014, FAO Sudan and the Government of Sudan’s CPF Steering Committee undertook a “mid-term review” to update and revise the CPF. This has been necessary because  of  its  unclear  alignment  with  the  evolving  country  situation  (with  regard  to  changes  in government policy since 2011), inherent lack of synergies and integration between development and emergency interventions and the need for a more resilience focus, lack of resource mobilization and communication strategies and a need to further prioritize the outcomes and outputs of the Framework, given its broad range of priority actions (*vis a vis* FAO’s comparative advantage in Sudan). 

As part of the CPF mid-term review process, FAO fielded a “programme formulation” mission to Sudan to support the development of a resilience-focused action plan to operationalize the CPF. The CPF “Plan of Action (PoA) for Sudan” was drafted on the basis of a detailed review of existing strategy documents (Chapters 3 and 4) and close consultations with decision makers of concerned government ministries, civil society, private sector organizations, policy and technical officers of the FAO Representation in Sudan and its programmes and projects, FAO/RNE and FAO Headquarters – taking  into  account  the  priorities  and  interventions  of  MoAI,  MoLFR,  MoEFPD  and  their 

3 

development partners – to ensure synergies and complementarities. Both the updated CPF and PoA were validated at a stakeholders’ workshop held in Khartoum on 27 November 2014. 

FAO  is  also  supporting  the  Government  of  Sudan  to  prepare  a  two-year  technical  cooperation programme (TCP) project to support the Government in implementation of the Comprehensive Africa 

Agriculture   Development   Programme   (CAADP)   in   Sudan   through   the   development   of   an “agricultural investment map/inventory” – leading to a “National Agriculture Investment Plan (NAIP) in Sudan” – to coordinate effective and efficient public investments and properly inform national and international  investors  in  the  agriculture  sector.  NAIP  would  comprise:  (i)  a  donor  platform  for agriculture  and  food  security;  and  (ii)  a  resource  mobilization  strategy  for  public  and  private investments in agriculture and food security. NAIP is expected to be completed by November 2015 – incorporating many of the capacity development elements of the PoA. 

The proposed CPF/PoA for Sudan and the forthcoming NAIP, with their strong narratives on the role of the agriculture sector and food industry in creating sustainable livelihoods for vulnerable men, women and youth and building the resilience of Sudanese rural communities and institutions, provides the basis for the formulation of a future multidonor programme for the country. In this context, the PoA  tends  to  focus  on  capacity  development  initiatives  such  as  promoting  the  strengthening  of knowledge  management  and  sharing  systems,  restructuring  governance  and  reforming  agricultural policies, promoting partnerships with the private sector, civil society and academia, re-orienting and strengthening  private  and  public  sector  agricultural  support  services,  upgrading  the  skills  of smallholder farmers and pastoralists, sustainable management of natural resources, reducing losses and  wastes,  adding  value  and  improving  the  quality  of  agricultural  produce  and  protecting  and restoring rural livelihoods (Chapter 5). This also includes the inclusive development of sustainable small-scale agriculture through building resilience to enhance food security and nutrition. 

On the other hand, NAIP tends to focus on developing and marketing a portfolio of public and private investment opportunities in agriculture and simplify related investment procedures and attract further private  sector  investments  in  sector  developmental/clustering  activities  (e.g.  extension  services, transportation, manufacturing of supplies and downstream agro-industries). 

During  the  PoA  formulation  exercise,  discussions  with  relevant  United  Nations  agencies  and development  partners  were  held  to  assess  possibilities  of  and  potential  added  value  for  capacity development   through   joint   programmes   which   would   be   implemented   through   partnerships (Chapter 6).  Contacts  were  also  established  with  key  multilateral  and  bilateral  donors in  order  to update them on FAO’s activities and solicit their interest in supporting FAO and the Government of Sudan’s  interventions  included  under  a  proposed  multidonor  programme  for  resilient  agricultural growth  and food and nutrition  security.  It  is  anticipated that  NAIP  preparation  will  build  on and integrate with these initiatives in order to complete a much larger agricultural investment for Sudan.

2. CHALLENGES  TO FOOD SECURITY AND AGRICULTURAL  DEVELOPMENT IN SUDAN

![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.006.jpeg)



2. **CHALLENGES TO** 

**FOOD SECURITY AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN SUDAN** 

1. **Socio-economic Context** 
1. **Economic Background** 

Sudan is a low income and food deficit country with a population of approximately 36.2 million, of which two-thirds is rural. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita averages USD 1 472 in nominal terms (World Bank; 2013). The growth rate of the GDP was 3.6 percent in 2014 – compared to 1.4 percent in 2013, 1.1 percent in 2012 and 1.9 percent in 2011. In 2012, agriculture accounted for nearly one-third of the total national GDP. In 2009, 34 percent of the total labour force was engaged in agriculture. Sudan is classified as a “low human development” country with a ranking of 166 out of 187  countries  (United  Nations  Development  Programme  [UNDP];  Human  Development  Report 2014). 

Substantial changes occurred in July 2011 as a result of the secession of South Sudan, including the loss of human and land resources, and three-quarters of the oil wealth. This reduced the Government’s revenues by 36.5 percent, caused a balance of payments shock, a fall in GDP growth of 0.7 percent from 2011 to 2012,, and an increase in annual inflation from 10 percent in 2010 to 37 percent in 2013. The United States Dollar (USD) exchange rate was cut by 66 percent in 2012, increasing the local cost of imported goods and services but improving export competitiveness. Recently, gold production has become the new panacea and has contributed to bringing back stability to the economy: gold exports were 46.1 tonnes in 2012 valued at USD 2.16 billion. The Government adopted a three-year Economic Salvation Programme (2012-2014) to respond to the challenges of the secession, and a comprehensive  reform  programme  to  address  the  deterioration  of  the  country’s  economic  and financial situation via exchange rate reform, tax increase and imposing higher import tariffs (Section 3.4).  However,  Sudan's  real  GDP  is  expected  to  grow  over  the  coming  years  as  domestic  oil production increases and the agricultural and gold sectors perform solidly 

Sudan’s   debt   burden   is   a   significant   development   constraint.   External   debt   in   2012   was USD 42 billion.  Unsettled  arrears  and  political  fallout  associated  with  Darfur  led  to  obstructing relationships  with  many  development  partners  and  continue  to  constrain  access  to  concessional financing, even though some humanitarian assistance continues. Sudan is potentially eligible for debt relief  under  different  initiatives,  including  the  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Countries  Initiative  (HIPC). Good  progress  has  been  made  towards  finalizing  the  technical  work  required  for  HIPC  decision making, but the country still lags at pre-decision point. The Government has completed so far three important steps: (i) reconciliation of more than 90 percent of the end-2010 external debt stock in collaboration  with  creditors;  (ii)  approval  by  the  Parliament  of  an  ambitious  “interim”  Poverty Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (I-PRSP)  in  June  2012  (Section  3.2);  and  (iii)  sound  track  record  of cooperation on economic policies and payments. The process for the preparation of the “full” II-PRSP was recently completed. 

Sudan has been severely affected by armed conflict for more than two decades, which cost some 1.5 million  lives  and  had  devastating  effects  on  rural  livelihoods  through  destruction  of  assets, displacing people and imposing restrictions on access to farmland. Conflicts continue to exist in border areas post secession (i.e. Darfur and Eastern Regions, Blue Nile, South Kordofan and Western Kordofan  States  and Abyei  protocol  area). Conflicts among pastoralists,  agropastoralists and crop farmers are widespread and rooted in disputes over ownership and use of natural resources. Land tenure practices and conversion of range and forest land into large mechanized farming is another cause of conflict. The recent influx of 90 000 refugees as a consequence of the current conflict in South  Sudan  (in  addition to  the  existing  caseload  of  350 000  refugees)  has  only  exacerbated  the situation.

2. **Rural Poverty**[^1]

Based on the latest available data, average rural poverty rates in Sudan are estimated at 58 percent, much higher than the national average and the urban poverty rate (47 and 27 percent, respectively[^2]) (National  Baseline  Household  Survey  [NBHS];  2009).  The  national  poverty  gap  of  16  percent indicates that average expenditure falls to an equivalent of USD 1.37 or less per person per day, decreasing to about USD 1.00 for the rural poor. Subsectors expected to be most affected by rural poverty  are  small-scale  farmers  and  agropastoralists  of  traditional  rainfed  farming  systems,  the landless and internally displaced people (IDP), households without assets and people in areas affected by drought and conflict. The main constraints on rural livelihoods are poor access to markets, lack of access to financial services, unpredictability of rainfall and water shortages, barriers on migratory routes  for  livestock,  pest  and  disease  outbreaks  and  conflicts  and  cattle  raiding.  Wage  labour represents more than half of cash incomes in rural areas, indicating the extent to which agriculture is practiced for subsistence. Unemployment is higher (19.8 percent) in rural than in urban (12.1 percent) areas, and for females (24.7 percent) than for males (13.9 percent). 

3. **Food Security** 

The  economic  crisis,  compounded  by  seasonal  hardship  and  heightened  conflict,  has  led  to  a deterioration of the food security and nutrition situation. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) estimates that 3.9 million people in Sudan are classified as “food insecure” and in “crisis” and “emergency” phases, with the majority of the affected population located in western parts of the country, particularly localities of the Darfur region and Red Sea State (Map 1). It should be noted that this data excludes populations from West Kordofan State, the Abyei protocol area, some localities in west Darfur and rebel-held areas of Blue Nile and South Kordofan States – where conflict and inaccessibility are adding to food insecurity and malnutrition levels. In this context, the target food  insecure  population  figure  according  to  the  United  Nations’  Humanitarian  Needs  Overview (HNO) for the 2015 Strategic Response Plan (SRP) is estimated at 4.6 million, which is 12 percent of Sudan’s total population (Section 2.6). 

Food insecurity is strongly correlated to Sudan’s rainfed agricultural subsector. Over 70 percent of staple commodities (i.e. sorghum and millet) are grown in rainfed localities. There was an historically poor harvest in 2013/2014 – 48 percent lower than the previous year’s crop and 68 percent lower than the five-year average. Livestock, animal products and staple food crops continuously deteriorated in terms of trade. Current millet, sorghum and wheat prices are, on average, respectively 92, 82 and 64 percent higher than 2013. Prices for these commodities were 150 to 160 percent above the July five- year average.  Seed shortages and increased costs of agricultural inputs have reduced the overall area planted,  with a consequence  on the  season’s  performances.  However,  2015  should  see  an above- average harvest due to higher than expected rains. 

Soaring and volatile domestic and world food prices challenged the country's capacity with high food import dependency, especially commodities such as wheat, sugar and dried milk. Sudan increased its imports  of  food  by 16  percent  between  2012 and  2013,  from USD  2 049  million  to  USD  2 372 million[^3]. Moreover, the high seasonal variability in Sudan’s own crop production continues to make the economy further vulnerable to food price increases and volatility.

2. **Sectoral Context**[^4]

Secession reduced Sudan’s total land area by 25 percent and the area classified as “arid” increased from 65 to 90 percent. Even so, 75 percent of  the former arable land (i.e. 73.5 million hectares) remains in the country, with just 16.8 million hectares cultivated. More critically, while the livestock population fell by only 28 percent to 105 million head, the range and forest resources on which they depend fell by 40 percent. Weaknesses in land tenure resulting from undefined land rights have, since traditional land rights were abolished in the 1970s, encouraged extensive and extractive modes of agriculture and livestock production, leading to overexploitation and degradation of natural resources, which has resulted in increased tensions and conflicts over natural resources, particularly between pastoral and settled farming communities. 

Large-scale irrigation accounts for only nine percent of the cultivated land area but it receives the lion’s  share  of  public  agricultural  spending.  The  Government  of  Sudan’s  Agricultural  Revival Programme (ARP), during the period 2008-2011, received  87 percent  of all Agricultural Bank of Sudan lending. 

The rainfed sector is typically divided into semi-mechanised farming, traditional crop production and livestock.  In  2011,  the  rainfed  subsectors  contributed  three-quarters  of  foreign  exchange  earnings from agricultural exports.

**Semi-mechanised rainfed farming** is practiced by large farmers and companies with low rent leases granted by the federal government. It is characterised by cheap access to land allowing unlimited horizontal expansion and a low-input/low-output system with limited concern for  sustainable land management. Investors plant according to market prices and availability of loans and subsidies. While providing  employment,  this  form  of  farming  encroaches  on  rangeland,  and  pastoralists  find themselves excluded from traditional pastures and water sources, creating conflict over access. Semi- mechanised  rainfed  farming  cultivates  14  million  *feddans*,  predominantly  producing  commercial sorghum grain for food security and sesame for export. The subsector produces 40 percent of the country’s sorghum, 62 percent of sesame and 90 percent of sunflower and short-staple cotton grown in the country. 

**Traditional  rainfed  farming**  covers  around  ten  million  hectares  and  is  practiced  by  family households with farms ranging from two to 50 hectares in size, farming for income and subsistence. Traditional  rainfed  farming  covers  about  18  million  *feddans*,  growing  about  95  percent  of  the country’s millet, 38 percent  of sorghum, 67 percent of groundnut and 38 percent of sesame. The subsector also grows gum Arabic, rosella and melon seeds for export. 

Productivity in rainfed cropping systems is declining due to land degradation, reduced soil fertility, traditional  tillage  practices,  lack  of  seed  quality  control  and  lack  of  knowledge  on  improved management practices. Use of improved seeds, zero tillage and water harvesting in pilot projects have clearly demonstrated room for major improvements in crop yields. Other challenges facing rainfed crop production include unpredictability of rainfall that typically allows only 40 to 80 percent of the area planted to be harvested, as well as pests and diseases (including locusts). Although crop failure normally still implies fodder for livestock, there is an urgent need for households to diversify their sources of income and add value to what they produce. The lack of accessible rural financial services and appropriate extension are also major impediments. 

**Livestock  production**,  an  important  component  of  the  traditional  rainfed  sector,  has  consistently contributed the largest share of agricultural GDP (i.e. 56 percent of agricultural exports in terms of value  in  2012).  In  addition  to  meat,  milk  and  skins,  livestock  are  valued  for  draught  power  and transport and as a mobile source of capital and insurance. In 2013, the livestock population of Sudan was estimated at 105 million head consisting of sheep – 40 million; goats – 30 million; cattle – 30 million; and camels – five million. 

Livestock are raised mostly by nomadic or semi-nomadic pastoralists practicing transhumance within Sudan  or  crossing  borders  into  neighbouring  countries.  In  addition  to  the  difficulties  faced  by livestock herders with regard to land tenure, the customary practice of allowing nomads to graze crop residues  after  the  harvest  has  mostly  disappeared  and  herders  are  expected  to  pay  lease-holding tenants for grazing and access to water, especially in eastern Sudan. In general, livestock productivity is  low  –  although  information  thereon  is  scattered  and  variable  –  due  to  disease  and  parasites, suboptimal breeding, poor herd management practices, reduced access to traditional range resources, stock routes, crop residues, insufficient water sources and overgrazing of remaining rangelands. 

Official estimates show that, after the separation of South Sudan, **forestry production** contributes only  one  to  two  percent  of  national  GDP  but  this  is  likely  underestimated  due  to  lack  of  data. Mismanagement of forest resources has led to desertification and destruction of watersheds, especially in central and northern Sudan. Expansion of agriculture into forestlands, tree felling for charcoal and firewood,  overgrazing,  forest  fires,  droughts  and  erratic  rainfall  are  major  factors.  The  main commercial forest product is gum Arabic that contributed eight percent to the value of agricultural exports  in  2012.  This  followed  many  years  of  decline  ended  by  the  2009  abolition  of  the  state monopoly on sales and the deep sector reform enabled through the World Bank/International Fund for Agricultural  Development  (IFAD)-funded  “Revitalizing  the  Sudan  gum  Arabic  production  and marketing project”. 

10 

Sudan has immense **fisheries resources**, especially the marine subsector along the Red Sea coast and within its inland waters along the Blue and White Nile Rivers, Lake Nubia and the dams of Roseires, Jebal  Awlia, Khasm Elgirba  and Marrewi. The secession  of  South  Sudan (and  loss  of the White Nile/Sudd  fish  resources)  significantly  reduced  the  supply  of  freshwater  fish  to  Sudan.  Whilst techniques and vessels used in inland fisheries remain artisanal in nature, participants in the fisheries are becoming increasingly commercialized. As market forces continue to exert pressure, there is a pattern of exploitation likely to expand in the inland waters. Vessels operating in the Red Sea are larger, including motorized dhows and trawlers. Currently, most fish in the country is consumed fresh and there is no formal export of fish or fishery products. Sudan is, however, a significant importer of fish. The price of fish in Sudan is beyond the purchasing power of an average-income household. Most  experience  with  aquaculture  has  been  along  the  coast  with  pearl  culture  but,  increasingly, investors  are  establishing  catfish  and  tilapia  pond  farms  in  the  irrigated  areas  of  the  country (e.g. Gezira and Gedaref States) to supply the developing population in these areas. 

The forestry and fisheries subsectors are treated as marginal activities in Sudan. They receive more attention from international organizations from an environmental and climate-change perspective than from the Government as having good potential for economic recovery. 

In terms of **gender**, women are generally the main unpaid contributors to household income and food production. Their participation in decision-making has been enhanced by the introduction of a quota for  their  representation  in  state  legislatures,  parties  and  community-based  organizations  (CBOs). IFAD’s  projects  experience  has  shown  that  where  women  have  access  to  capacity  building  and microfinance,   they  perform  outstandingly.   Women’s   empowerment   is   hindered   by  illiteracy, customary law, social pressures and heavy workloads. 

In  2013,  Sudan’s  export  trade  of  USD  7 086  million  was  dominated  by  oil  and  gold  (totaling 72 percent  of  the  total  revenues).  Livestock  and  animal  products  (nine  percent),  sesame  (seven percent), cotton (one percent) and gum Arabic (one percent) were also important export earners. The same  year,  a  quester  of  the  country’s  imports,  which  had  a  total  value  of  USD  9 918  million, comprised foodstuffs – 42 percent of which was wheat and wheat flour. 

3. **Hazards and Stresses to Crops, Livestock, Fisheries and Forestry Production** 

Sudan – particularly the country’s traditional rainfed farming subsector – is prone to most of the risks, hazards and stresses known to mankind, including conflict and displacement, droughts, prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall, floods, soaring food and agricultural input prices, transboundary plant and animal diseases and pests and wildfires, as well as conservative cultural practices, restricted access to land,   water  and   pastures  by  smallholder   farmers,   agropastoralists  and   pastoralists   and  land degradation  and  desertification.  Assessment  of  such  multi-hazard  risks  and  vulnerabilities  (i.e. development of risk profiles for livelihood groups) is the foundation for the integration of resilience programming  and  preparedness  at  country  level  under  CPFs  and  their  PoAs.  Key  elements  of  a livelihood  risk  profile  include:  hazard  identification  and  mapping  (*what  and  where?*);  seasonal calendars (*when?*); hazard impact on vulnerable groups (*who?*); coping capacity; and risk ranking (*prioritization?*). 

The United  States  Agency for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  World  Food  Programme (WFP)-supported Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) has categorized Sudan into 19 livelihood zones (13 of which are considered “smallholder rainfed farming” (*i.e. i to xiii below*), namely:

4. **Status of the Agriculture Sector** 
1. **Current Strengths and Weaknesses** 

In 2007, the Government of Sudan, as part of its preparation of ARP, undertook a diagnosis of the agriculture sector by using a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis. This approach explored the weaknesses and strengths in the performance of the sector, opportunities for development and the threats involved. Given the secession of South Sudan, the loss of oil revenues and subsequent downturn in the country’s economy since 2011, an updated version of this diagnosis could be interpreted as presented below. 

The **strengths of  the Sudanese agriculture sector** have remained largely unchanged since 2007, with the exception that institutional capacities have become so outdated that they might be lost for future development initiatives. 



|**Current Strengths** |
| - |
||
|✓   Vast agricultural lands suitable for cultivation. |
|✓   Water resources from rainfall, rivers and underground aquifers sufficient to meet the requirements of raising different food and industrial crops, the livestock population, fish resources and increasing the areas under forests and pasture. |
|✓   Huge livestock resource potential and sizable fish resources. |
|✓   A network of agricultural faculties located all over the country to provide trained manpower in all areas of specialization required for agricultural development. |
|✓   Generations of trained manpower capable of leading the process of agricultural development. |
|✓   Adoption of a federal system of government that encourages the participation of local authorities and rural communities in national development programmes. |
|✓   Planned improvements of infrastructure such as roads, electricity, communication technologies, silos, quarantine facilities and abattoirs initiated that should help promote free-market mechanisms and send signals to producers to increase productivity and production coming to the markets. |
|✓   A strategic geographical location which facilitates the marketing of agricultural commodities in regional and international markets (e.g. Near Eastern, eastern and North African countries). |
|✓   Commitment and a political will for equitable and sustainable socio-economic development. |

On  the  whole,  **the  weaknesses  of  the  sector  (and  opportunities  for  change)**  have  remained unchanged since 2007 – if anything, they have worsened given the recent decline of the Sudanese economy. However, changes in agricultural policy (e.g. ARP-II) – as part of the Second Five-Year Development Plan (2012-2016) and Three-Year Economic Salvation Programme (2012-2014) – and recent  revisions  to  regulatory  frameworks  on  gum  Arabic  and  seed  production,  establishment  of producer  organizations  and  food  security  policy  (Chapter  3)  have  meant  that  certain  institutional obstacles  have  been  softened  (but  further  capacity  development  is  required  before  they  can  be removed). 



|**Current Weaknesses (opportunities for change)** |
| - |
|o  Fragile  state  of  the  national  economy  and  high  inflation  precludes  both  public  and  private  sector investment in rural areas and the agriculture sector. |
|o  Low levels of productivity to all factors of crop, livestock, fisheries and forestry production – producers are trapped in  traditional systems of production resulting in  underdevelopment and weak technical, managerial  and  financial  capacities  of  the  producers;  and  outdated  systems  of  production  in  the agriculture sector due to absence of a holistic vision for agricultural development. |

15 



|o Weak research and extension services and shortage of improved seeds, with a lack of application of recommended research findings. |
| - |
|o The  existing  infrastructure  is  not  commensurate  with  the  requirements  of  modern  agricultural development – lack of public and private sector investment. |
|o  Lack of coordination of policies between the various natural resource users, i.e. representatives of large and  small-scale  farmers,  pastoralists  and  agropastoralists,  fisherfolk,  forest-dependent  people  and women. |
|o The preparation of agricultural plans lack the scientific and operational approaches, e.g. projections of production and exports lack precision and are often exaggerated. |
|o Lack of capacity to produce agricultural equipment and inputs locally. |
|o Inadequacy of procedures that control the quality of products, and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures which safeguard food safety. |
|o  Lack of strict measures to apply regional and international agreements on enforcement of standards and related capacity building – that jeopardizes the competitiveness of Sudanese products in local and international markets. |
|o Weak linkages between stakeholders deprive local communities (and their small-scale producers) of the opportunity to participate in policy making and to reap the benefits of a balanced rural development. |
|o Deep-rooted rivalries between professional and trade union organizations hampered the cooperation needed for optional use of agricultural resources. |
|o Tenuous peace and insecurity, especially in areas of the country with high potential for agricultural production |

2. **Potential Opportunities and Threats** 

The **potential opportunities of the Sudanese agriculture secto**r have remained unchanged since 2007,  but  recent  liberalization  of  some  agricultural  commodities;  increasing  income  creation opportunities for  smallholders through the  recognition of  farmer  field schools (FFSs);  community animal resource development services and producer organizations; and improving food and nutrition security information flows, knowledge management and policy development have enhanced many of the opportunities listed below. 



|**Potential Opportunities** |
| - |
||
|✓   The realization of peace and security (and their economic benefits) will encourage settlement in the rural areas and avail resources for the development of the rural sector. |
|✓   The  possibility of  increased  oil  and  gold  production  and  revenue  provides an  important source of financing rural infrastructure and agricultural equipment and inputs. |
|✓   The change towards an open economy creates a conducive environment for entering into partnership with  national  and  international  investors  and  entrepreneurs,  including  public-private  partnerships (PPPs). |
|✓   Public awareness of the fact that agriculture is the main source of rapid and balanced economic growth has increased. |
|✓   Potential for utilizin g  Su d an ’ s  sha re  o f  Ri ver  N il e  wat ers  efficiently and effectively. |
|✓   Application of small and large-scale water harvesting technologies on a large geographical scale. |
|✓   Utilization of forward and backward linkages between agriculture and industry through value chain development and PPPs. |
|✓   The strategic location of Sudan in North and East Africa and the Arab World and its proximity to Europe makes it a potential centre for agricultural trade. |

16 

**Potential  threats  to  the  sector**  have  worsened  since  2007,  in  particular  levels  of  insecurity  and conflict, land  degradation and  desertification  and  the frequency of  extreme  weather  events  in the country have increased. 



|**Potential Threats** |
| - |
||
|o Rapid population growth – puts upward pressure on consumption of water and agriculture products. |
|o Escalation of political and tribal conflicts into more peaceful and stable areas of Sudan will curtail any recent initiatives in agricultural and rural development. |
|<p>- Th e   con tin u o u s   d eteriora tio n   o f   th e   cou n try’ s   n at u ra l   reso u rc e   b ase   has  a negative  impact  on  the settlement of livestock producers and the development of the national herd. It  is  also  associated  with insecurity and  tribal  conflicts over resources, which could escalate as  the situation worsens. ![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.012.png)</p><p>- 85 percent of animal resources depends on pastoral and transhumant systems of production, which render the provision of services and the transfer of technology needed for improvement difficult. </p>|
|o The increasing risk of transboundary plant and animal pests and diseases limit the development of high- value food chains in the country. |
|o Climatic change and variability resulting in reduced production and fluctuations in productivity (Section 2.5). |
|o  Despite more favourable agriculture policies, the institutions and procedures which control public funds |
|are  not  suitable  for  financing  agricultural  producers,  especially  smallholders  (including  suboptimal legislation and credit), nor is it appropriate for financing community infrastructure. |
|o Trade barriers established by developed countries to protect their producers limit access for Sudanese exporters to their markets. |

5. **Climate Change** 

A recent “environmental and climate change assessment” undertaken by IFAD[^6]  analysed historical temperature and rainfall patterns, modelled estimated future projections of precipitation and rainfall as well as future runoff of the Nile flows until 2050. The assessment indicates that climate change is already leading to more severe and chronic droughts and threatening all rainfed agricultural systems. 

Increased temperatures and declining rainfall have shifted the boundary between desert and semi- desert zones southwards by between 50 and 200 km over the past 80 years. This trend is continuing and large areas of the remaining semi-desert and low rainfall savannah – key livestock production zones – are at risk of desertification. By 2050, vulnerability assessments show that temperatures are likely to rise by between 1.5 and 2.5°C throughout the country (1.6°C in Atbara; 2.1°C in Khartoum; 0.6°C in El Obied; 1.5°C in El Fasher and Gedaref; 2.0°C in Kassala; 0.8°C in Damazene; and 1.3°C in Malakal). Average annual rainfall is expected to increase in most areas but with significant changes in its seasonality and more frequent droughts. The highest annual reductions are predicted for Gedaref and Kassala States; while the highest seasonal variability is predicted to be in Northern, North Darfur, River Nile and Red Sea States. Increased temperatures and higher rates of evapotranspiration will increase water demand for agriculture significantly; and accordingly, the potential for moisture stress in crops and animals will increase. Rainfed cropping areas will shrink, and the impact of droughts will be increased. 

Agricultural yields are expected to fluctuate more widely over time and to converge to a significantly lower longer-term average. This will vary across crops and agro-ecological zones, but impacts will be most significant in rainfed areas. Declines in yields could range from between five and 50 percent, or 

17 

between  15  and  25  percent  in  terms  of  value  of  agricultural  output  by  2050,  reducing  GDP  by between USD 7 billion and USD 14 billion. Declines in yields could be up to 56 percent by 2050, the steepest decline in the world[^7]. Vulnerability to climate change is strongly correlated with dependency on non-irrigated agriculture and livestock, coping capacity (i.e. “household wealth”) and household food security (i.e. “food consumption”): One hundred percent of poor households and 25 percent of borderline households are considered vulnerable to drought. The issues outlined above related to land tenure are compounding vulnerability to climate change. 

6. **Humanitarian Context** 

Sudan has been experiencing a protracted crisis in various guises and different locations since 1984. At  present,  conflict  and  displacement  is concentrated in the five  states of the Darfur  Region and North, South and West Kordofan; Blue Nile; Kassala; and Red Sea States. Over the past four decades, the situation has been exacerbated by occasional droughts, floods, outbreaks of plant and animal pests and diseases and soaring food and agricultural input prices, which are now increasing in frequency. 

The  United  Nations  Humanitarian  Coordination  Team  for  Sudan  has  recently  completed  the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) for the Sudan 2015 Strategic Response Plan (SRP)[^8]  (Section 3.10.2). Overall, HNO and SRP (currently under finalization) proposes to target some 5.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including life-saving interventions, protection from conflict and violence, strengthening household and community coping mechanisms and, where conditions permit, supporting longer-term solutions to the plight of IDPs and refugees. This represents over 20 percent of the country’s total population and an increase of seven percent over the 6.9 million people in need in 2014. 

The 2015 Sudan SRP caseload includes the following humanitarian categories: 

- 5.3 million food insecure people; 
- 3.1 million displaced people; 
- 171 000 IDP returnees; 
- 155 000 refugees and asylum seekers; 
- 91 000 refugee returnees; 
- 550 000 South Sudanese refugees; and 
- 1.6 million non-displaced but livelihoods insecure. 

The HRP 2015 targets 5.4 million, of which 80 percent (4.2 million) are food insecure.   Under the HRP 2015, FAO pledges for USD 24 million to save lives and restore livelihoods of more than 50 percent (2.4 million people) of the most food insecure.

3. AGRICULTURAL POLICY, STRATEGY AND INSTITUTIONAL  CONTEXT OF SUDAN

![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.013.jpeg)



**3. AGRICULTURAL POLICY, STRATEGY AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF SUDAN** 

1. **National Institutional Setting** 

Sudan has a federal system of Government of 18 states, with significant levels of autonomy over legislation,  budget  execution,  development  programming  and  service  delivery.  For  food  and agricultural matters, the Federal MoAI, MoLFR and MoEFPD - FAO’s apex partner institutions - retain  certain  powers  over  land  tenure,  water  management,  environmental  conservation,  pest  and disease surveillance and control, input supply and trade. Each state has its own ministry of agriculture, which  is  FAO’s  local  partner  institution,  usually  responsible  for  the  crops,  small-scale  irrigation, livestock and fisheries subsectors. 

Main institutional weaknesses relate to budget formulation and allocation, staffing, lack of attention to rainfed agriculture  and  variation in the transfer  and disbursement  of federal funds.  Difficulties in expanding the local revenue base adversely affect state counterpart funding. In addition, there is a lack of clarity on the roles in dealing with agriculture and natural resources and political support varies across states. Mechanisms for harmonizing and streamlining policies and strategies across the states are  absent. Policies  have  historically been top-down  and  marked  by frequent changes, inadequate enabling  environment  and  insufficient  resources  for  implementation.  Smallholder  farmers  and pastoralists and their representatives do not usually participate in policy-making processes. Cross- cutting issues in the rural sector, such as focus on gender, youth and climate change are mainstreamed in the main government policies. Policy environment is also constraining for the private sector as access to finance is constrained, taxation is excessive, charges are not related to service provision, there is more than one exchange rate, export/import controls exist and access to land is problematic. However, in the agriculture sector, the Government is keen to boost private investments and increase exports. 

Most  of  Sudan’s  strategies  and  plans  incorporate  poverty reduction targets.  The  Sudan  long-term “Quarter Centennial Strategy” (2007-2031), has strong commitments to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including increasing agricultural incomes and employment, promoting food security and poverty reduction, increasing agricultural exports and strengthening linkage with other sectors. The  second  Five-Year  Development  Plan  (2012-2016)  and  its  Three-Year  Economic  Salvation Programme aim to provide a foundation for the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and ARP. 

2. **Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers I and II (2011-2016)** 

The I-PRSP was approved by the Parliament in June 2012 and the World Bank in March 2013. The “full” PRSP is currently under preparation, under the guidance of the African Development Bank (AfDB). The I-PRSP has four pillars: (i) strengthening governance and institutional capacity of the public  sector;  (ii)  reintegrating  IDPs  and  other  displaced  populations;  (iii)  developing  human resources; and (iv) promoting economic  growth and employment  creation. The targets set for the MDGs under the I-PRSP are very ambitious, and poverty is expected to decrease from 46.5 percent (2006 estimate) to 23.3 percent by 2015. Reducing poverty by 50 percent is probably unlikely, given the current indications of rising poverty. 

The I-PRSP is built on a medium-term macro-economic framework that encapsulates those growth and poverty reduction policies. The macro-economic objectives for the 2013-2015 period set in I- IPRSP aim at: (i) sustaining an average growth rate of about four percent; (ii) bringing down inflation to ten percent; (iii) reducing the overall budget deficit to three percent; and (iv) containing the current account deficit to 3.1 percent of the GDP. 

21 

3. **Second Five-Year Development Plan (2012-2016)** 

The Second Five-Year Development Plan is a post-comprehensive peace action plan, following the secession of South Sudan in 2011, that extends the national planning process until 2016, a year later than the MDGs and at the same time as the UNDAF cycle. The plan is arranged into four sectors: namely:  (i)  economic;  (ii)  political  governance  and  management;  (iii)  socio-cultural  issues;  and (iv) corporate governance and capacity building. 

The Plan targets economic stability and growth with a primary focus on sustainable development and poverty reduction  in the medium term,  identifying  major  programmes  and  projects in  nine  areas: namely: (i) heeding the financial shock in the first three years in order to create economic stability (including a three-year austerity programme (2012-2014); (ii) improve on agricultural production to meet local needs and to supplement the loss of oil revenue through export (Sudan lost 43 percent of its export  revenue  as  75  percent  of  oil  produced  became  the  property  of  the  new  South  State); 

3) industrial development and expansion; (iv) meeting the MDGs; (v) reforming the civil service and public administration; (vi) improving the local and federal administrative system; (vii) improving general and higher education to meet the needs and demands of the market; (viii) seeking strategic investment and partnerships; and (ix) enhancing the private sector’s role in leading development. 
4. **Three-Year Economic Salvation Programme (2012-2014)** 

The  Three-Year  Economic  Salvation  Programme  aimed  at  restructuring  the  general  budget  and rectifying the overall deficit of the budget and its expected effect on the socio-economic situation that evolved due to the secession of South Sudan. The objectives of the Programme are to: (i) increase tax collection effort and rationalize current spending and development spending; (ii) mobilize and tap productive  sectors  capacities  to  bridge  the  gap  in  major  basic  commodities;  (iii)  activate  human resources and reduce unemployment rate; and (iv) increase foreign private sector investments rate of inflows. 

Policies required include: (i) activation of self-sufficiency policies in basic crops through ARP; (ii) redirection  of  emphasis  from the  construction  sector  to  mineral  mining,  especially gold,  to  cover deficits  in  foreign  currency  revenues;  (iii)  design  programmes  that  re-operate  idle  factories  to contribute effectively to the  national GDP; (iv) issue incentive package policies for nonpetroleum exports, e.g. gold, livestock, oilseeds and fodder crops; (v) encourage import-substitute commodities, e.g. wheat and sugar; and (vi) organize transboundary trade with neighbouring countries. 

5. **Agricultural Revival Programmes (2008-2014)** 

Building on the "Green Mobilization" programme of 2006 and the first Five-Year Development Plan (2007-2011), the Government of Sudan adopted a five-year **ARP-I** in 2008 that advocated agriculture as  the  engine  to  effectively  contribute  to  economic  growth  and  export  performance  and  to simultaneously advance people’s livelihoods, reduce poverty, improve food security and nutrition and develop and protect natural resources. The ARP had six strategic objectives: (i) promoting exports of crops and livestock to reduce dependence on oil; (ii) increasing productivity and efficiency at the production and processing stages (in particular wheat, rice, sugar beet, sugarcane, oil seeds, organic fruits and vegetables and green and dry fodder, each in selected states); (iii) achieving food security; 

4) reducing poverty by 50 percent by 2015, generating job opportunities and increasing per capita income;  (v)  achieving  balanced  growth  in  all  regions  of  the  country;  and  (vi)  developing  and protecting natural resources to ensure renewal and sustainability. 

   ARP-I focused on the development of the traditional agriculture sector, including the introduction of strategies for strengthening CBOs, making the village as a centre of development, and emphasised water  harvesting  and  technology  development  and  technology  transfer  programmes.  Despite  this focus,  the  traditional  rainfed  agriculture  and  livestock  subsectors  received  low  priority  in  public spending allocated to agriculture and food security – in favour of rehabilitating and developing the 

22 

irrigated subsector. The Programme also planned for empowering the role of the private sector in agriculture  through:  (a)  removal  of  administrative  and  financial  bureaucracy;  (b)  resolving  land ownership, land-use  problems  and  conflicts over  land acquisition;  (c)  privatization of  government schemes; and (d) promotion of agricultural insurance and risk management schemes. 

An  independent  evaluation  in  2011  concluded  that  ARP-I  had  fulfilled  its  funding  commitments despite budgetary constraints, and had substantial achievements, albeit not meeting desired outcomes. As  a  result,  it  was  extended  a  further  three  years  (i.e.  ARP-II)  with  an  increased  role  for  state governments in guiding planning and mobilizing support. 

**ARP-II  (2012-2014)**  therefore  continues  the  policies  of  ARP-I,  but  expects  that  the  Government commits  to  the  fulfilment  of  the  Maputo  Declaration  by  the  African  Union  Heads  of  States  for allocating ten percent of the national budget to the agriculture sector and honours the CAADP’s target of achieving at least a six percent rate in agricultural growth. In this context, **nine mission measures** of ARP-II can be summarized as follows: 

1. Adopting  conducive  macro-  and  sectoral  policies  that  promote  investment,  develop infrastructure for water provision (in particular water-harvesting schemes), build feeder roads, establish livestock routes and provide marketing infrastructure. 
1. Building productive capacity of producers through institutional reform and training (in line with recent legislation on “producer organizations” [Section 3.9]) – in order to enhance the efficiency of farmers and pastoralist organizations as a basis of self-initiatives in supporting governance activities. 
1. Addressing land tenure and land rights problems. 
1. Improving  agricultural  support  services  in  terms  of  research,  technology  transfer  and extension, agricultural education, markets, information and communication, and agricultural insurance services. 
1. Improving system efficiency by increased farm intensities, marketing efficiency and value addition through processing – in order to create jobs in rural areas for poverty reduction, induce settlement in the countryside and reduce urbanization rates (which have increased tremendously over the last two decades). 
1. Protecting  and  developing  natural  resources  by  increasing  land  cover  –  in  particular  the expansion of reforestation schemes, rehabilitation of forests and conservation for enhanced environmental sustainability. 
1. Building  agricultural  input  industries  with  links  to  the  production-processing-marketing chain. 
1. Implementing product quality control and safety measures. 
1. Building strategic partnerships to utilize economies of scale and have better access to new technology, international markets and financial institutions. 
6. **Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme in Sudan**[^9]

The **CAADP** is endorsed by African governments under the African Union’s New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) initiative to accelerate growth, eliminate poverty and hunger and promote agricultural exports in Africa. CAADP comprises **four agricultural pillars**, namely: 

1. Expand sustainable land management and reliable water control system. 
1. Improve rural infrastructure and trade-related capacities for more market access. 
1. Increase food supply, reduce hunger and improve food emergency in case of crises. 
1. Improve agricultural research, technology transfer and adoption. 

23 

The  pillars  are  supported  by  academic  and  professional  training  in  agriculture,  and  supply  of knowledge systems, peer review and policy dialogue within the Sudanese context. 

The CAADP’s framework is implemented through a future vision and action plan with main priority areas for public sector investment, which have guided countries such as Sudan (e.g. ARP-II) that include:   (1)   creation   of   appropriate   atmosphere   for   sustainable   development   of   agricultural production; (2) capacity building of producers and institutions; (3) addressing agricultural land issues; (4)   developing  support  services;  (5)   development  and  modernization  of  agricultural  system; 

6) protection   and   development   of   natural   resources;   (7)   development   of   agro-industries 
6) implementation  of  quality  control  and  safety  measures;  and  (9)  establishment  of  international partnerships. 

   7. **IGAD’s Initiative to End Drought Emergencies in the Horn of Africa – Sudan Country** **Programming Paper** 

In 2012, the Governments of Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan, with support of an FAO/ Consultative  Group  for  International  Agricultural  Research  (CGIAR)  technical  consortium (coordinated by the International Livestock Research Institute), undertook a detailed analysis of key priorities for addressing food insecurity in the Horn of Africa and national priorities of the respective country agriculture sectors within the framework of CAADP. This Intergovernmental Authority on 

Development (IGAD)[^10]  Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Initiative (IDDRSI) led to the preparation of a Common Programming Framework at regional and country levels, titled “IGAD’s Initiatives to End Drought Emergencies in the Horn of Africa”. 

In Sudan, drought-prone areas cover a third of the country’s landmass but nearly 90 percent of its productive  area  (crops,  pastures  and  forests)12    across  15  of  19  livelihood  zones13   (i.e.  rainfed cultivated, agropastoral, pastoral and tree-dependent based) and parts of all 18 states. Drought effects are more widespread in western parts, moderate in eastern and southern parts and lesser in central parts. 

Preparation  of  the  Sudan  “Country  Programming  Paper  (CPP)”  in  2014  represented  a  detailed assessment on the status of the nation’s agriculture sector with recommendations for a total of 21 outcomes/components  comprising  72  priority  interventions  in  livelihood  resilience  and  economic recovery  of  the  “drylands”  and  drought-prone  areas.  The  priority  interventions  proposed  by  CPP (Annex 1) include investment in both physical infrastructure (e.g. feeder roads, irrigation systems, quarantine stations and food processing units)14  and capacity development of government agencies, non-state actors and men and women farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk and tree-dependent families (e.g. livelihood support, research and knowledge management, and advisory and extension systems). The capacity development interventions proposed by CPP are therefore highly relevant to the preparation of the CPF/PoA. 

The programme objective of CPP is similar to that of the proposed PoA, i.e. ***“to improve livelihoods and  increase  resilience  capacities  of  the  different  economic  sectors  of  the  drought-prone communities in the rainfed and irrigated areas of the country”*** (except that PoA covers all hazard zones  and  not  specifically drought-prone  areas). The  specific  objectives  of  CPP  are  ***“to  enhance livelihood capacities, strengthen resilience and emergency preparedness*** through: 

24 

- rehabilitation and development of the water and arable land resources network in the drought- prone regions of the country to increase water availability for domestic, livestock, agriculture and energy use; and enhance regional cooperation and coordination of ownership on transboundary water resources; 
- development  of  livestock  infrastructure  to  improve  productivity,  access  to  markets  and  the livestock export routes to the Middle East and livestock health management; 
- rehabilitation and development of rangelands and forests to enhance availability of forage in a sustainably  managed  environment,  using  PPP  and  community  participation  approaches  for enhanced contribution to peacebuilding and conflict resolution to reduce natural resources-based conflicts that hamper livestock production; and 
- capacity  building  for  individuals  and  institutions  dealing  with  water  resources  and  livestock value chain development, and the review of associated policies.  The capacity building effort will also target legal and institutional frameworks so as to improve land tenure issues, water use and 

  livestock production systems”. 

MoAI and MoLFR acknowledge CPP as the most important agricultural policy document prepared in recent times. And, both ministries are now basing their future programming (including ARP-III) on the  strategic  framework  of  CPP;  hence,  the  prominence  given  to  CPP  in  this  PoA  (Annex  1). However, the CPP tends to focus on natural resource management and development of pastoralist and agropastoralist farming systems and less on rainfed and irrigated cropping systems. In this regard, further attention is required, for example, to agricultural research and development for climate change adaptation  (CCA),  quality  seed  systems,  post-harvest  management  and  technology  transfer  and extension services. 

8. **Darfur Development Strategy (2013-2019)** 

The 2011 “Doha Document for Peace in Darfur (DDPD)” paved the way for the Government of Sudan and the United Nations to prepare a six-year development strategy for the Darfur Region15  in early 2013. The **“Developing Darfur: A Reconstruction and Recovery Strategy (DDS)”** aims “*at realizing  short-term  and  medium-term  objectives  in  the  fields  of  rehabilitation,  reconstruction, construction and development, taking into consideration urgent needs and the need to work out the basis for long-term development – giving special attention to programmes and projects which will enable Darfur to speed up the transition from relief to development*”. The DDS is based on situation analyses undertaken by ten thematic working groups as part of the Darfur Joint Assessment Mission (DJAM) in late 2012 – including “agriculture, livestock and rural livelihoods”[^11]. 

The DDS recognizes the shortfalls inherent within a project-based and sector-specific “wish-list” and instead presents an integrated, comprehensive and stakeholder-driven roadmap to holistically initiate the ambitious objective outlined by DDPD – namely a stable, peaceful and prosperous Darfur. The independent bricks of the thematic working groups lend themselves conceptually to the formation of **three main pillars** necessary to support the region-wide DDS. All aspects of recovery under DDS will not be ad hoc given that there are elements of all these that need to be developed as an integrated programme in a time-conscious manner, including: (i) peace and stability (e.g. land and community reconciliation and reintegration); (ii) governance and rule of law (e.g. for long-term service delivery); (iii)  private  sector  development  (i.e.  to  ensure  consistent  economic  recovery);  (iv)  basic  public services (e.g. capacity development to maintain community reconstruction); (v) development of rural livelihoods (e.g. agricultural markets and livestock improvement); and (vi) return and reintegration (e.g. for the stabilization of the rural sector). 

25 

The three interconnected pillars of DDS and their overall aims are as follows: 

1. **Governance, Justice and Reconciliation** – to contribute policy support, technical assistance and capacity enhancement  to State  governments  to enable  them to  more  effectively execute  their mandates, especially at the local (decentralized) level and thus oversee recovery of the region and initiate the revival of basic infrastructure and support to conflict-affected populations (***including public delivery services, land use and land development***). 
1. **Reconstruction** – to support the recovery and stabilization of war-affected populations, whose economic and social lives have been severely disrupted; fundamental to any recovery programme is the construction and restoration of physical infrastructure and basic service recovery, such as water  supplies  in  villages,  schools,  health  posts  and  community  policing,  as  well  as  linking communities and markets by constructing and improving vital road, rail and air links, promoting resource-efficient  housing  and  restoring  productive  systems  (***including  feeder  roads,  water points and food nutrition***). 
1. **Economic Recovery** – to contribute positively towards poverty alleviation and transitioning the Darfur Region to development in an equitable and environmentally sustainable manner through directly  supporting  agricultural  operations,  demarcating  stock  routes,  promoting  alternative energy sources, improving the business climate and access to credit, etc., ***including agricultural policy, extension services, veterinary services, crop and livestock production  (and irrigation and pasture development), crop and livestock value chain development and natural resource management (NRM)***. FAO is co-chairing this pillar with DRA. 

Further details on the agriculture-related objectives and key outputs of DDS pillars are provided in Annex 2. The DDS also includes a listing of priority **“foundational and short-term activities”** for each of the three pillars. Short-term agriculture-related activities, where FAO has been recommended as the lead or support United Nations agency, have been estimated at a total cost of USD 25 million (***including:  establishment  of  public  delivery  systems and  [land]  conflict management  processes; feasibility  studies  for  produce  marketing,  rehabilitation  of  water  supplies,  and  food  nutrition assessment and training; and agricultural policy development, strengthening agricultural support services,  pest  and  disease  surveillance,  value  chain  analyses  and  initiation  of  value  chain development,  NRM  assessments,  feasibility  studies  for  water  harvesting  systems,  restoration  of shelter belts, initiation of community-based range management, and improvement of alternative energy sources***)[^12]. 

Many of  the  themes,  key  outputs  and  activities  proposed  for  Pillar  III were  based on  a  strategic framework for “natural resources management for food and nutrition security in Darfur” prepared by FAO in January 2012. This strategic framework now gives direction to FAO’s future relief, recovery and development work in the region, in particular on the intersection between natural resources and sustainable crop and livestock production systems dimension of these resources (Section 4.1.4). 

9. **Recent Legislation** 

Despite the slower than expected progress, a number of pro-poor acts and regulations have benefitted the agriculture sector, namely: 

- The  Gum  Arabic  Act  of  2009  liberalized  trade  and  has  had  a  major  impact  on  improving production and benefits to smallholder farmers. 
- A new Seed Act was approved in 2010 to upgrade the National Seed Administration to ensure plant breeders’ rights and provide sound regulation of the seed production chain. 

26 

- The Agricultural and Livestock Professional Organization Act of 2011 replaced existing laws on farmers,  producers  and  pastoral  unions  and  establishes  the  legal  basis  for  new  autonomous producers’ organizations. 
- A Comprehensive Food Security Policy was formulated in 2013 (with technical support of FAO) and is awaiting official endorsement. It incorporates actions on food security and nutrition policy, identifying players, timings and synergies to already ongoing food security-related endeavours. The policies are envisaged to be coordinated by a Food Security Technical Secretariat (FSTS) under the umbrella of a proposed National Food Security Council. 
10. **United Nations Development Frameworks and Response Plans** 
1. **United Nations Development Assistance Framework (2013-2016)** 

The  current  **United  Nations  Development  Assistance  Framework  (UNDAF)**  recognizes  the interface  between  humanitarian  and  development  engagement,  and  that  these  stages  often  occur simultaneously; neither can be fully realized without acknowledging the other. Achieving a smooth transition  to  recovery  and  longer-term  development,  while  continuing  to  practice  responsible humanitarianism, thus represents the cornerstone for the Framework. 

Under this overarching goal, four inter-related pillars of cooperation have emerged as particularly critical  for  United  Nations  System  support  during  the  UNDAF  period:  (1)  Poverty  Reduction, Inclusive Growth and Sustainable Livelihoods; (2) Basic Services; (3) Governance and Rule of Law, including broad institutional strengthening and deepening of basic rights and justice for all; and (4) Social  Cohesion,  Peace  Consolidation  and  Peace  Dividends,  with  high-level  efforts  at  the  centre complemented by comprehensive development initiatives at local levels. Each pillar is represented by two outputs, which are sensitive to both early recovery and longer-term development needs of the people. Outputs of FAO’s proposed CPF/PoA are restricted to **three outcomes**[^13] of UNDAF, namely: 

1. **Pillar 1; Outcome 1:** People in Sudan, with special attention to youth, women and populations in need, have improved opportunities for decent work and sustainable livelihoods and are better protected  from  external  shocks,  thereby  reducing  poverty  (***including  “revitalization  of agriculture”)***. 
1. **Pillar 1; Outcome 2:** Populations vulnerable to environmental risks and climate change become more  resilient,  and  relevant  institutions  are  more  effective  in  the  sustainable  management  of natural  resources  (***including  “combating  environmental  degradation,  climate  change  and disaster risks”***). 
1. **Pillar 2; Outcome 3:** Government and stakeholders have evidence-based policies, strategic plans and  mechanisms  to  ensure  an  enabling  environment  for  improved  basic  services  (***including “conducive,  capacity  development-oriented  context  for  the  Government  to  take  the  lead  in developing   sectoral   investment,  implementation  and  management,  ensuring   sustainable delivery of services focusing more on providing the enabling environment to develop the civil service;  sound Government  structures  are  in place that promote  systemic reforms for  wide sectoral  coordination,  accountable  governance  and  effective  and  efficient  coordination mechanisms based on effective sectoral information and monitoring systems; and finalization and activation of sectoral polices and strategic plans”***). 

Given the importance of the agriculture sector to the recovery of the Sudanese economy – especially since the loss of oil revenues to South Sudan – development of the sector is under-represented in the Outcomes of UNDAF (2013-2016) and FAO’s role in implementing Pillars 1 and 2 is limited. The United Nations Country Team might therefore consider revising those Pillars, expanding their outputs and increasing FAO’s involvement in the activities related to food and nutrition security, production 

27 

and employment generation in rural areas, land and water management, agricultural climate change adaptation, technology generation and transfer, control of transboundary plant and animal pests and diseases,  policy  development  and  knowledge  management  and  sharing,  resilience  building,  etc.  – given FAO’s recent institutional support to ARP-II and DDS. 

2. **Strategic Response Plans** 

Sudan has enjoyed only two periods of nationwide peace (from 1952 to1955 and from 1972 to 1983) since  independence,  and  it  is  one  of  just  a  small  handful  of  countries  that  have  launched  a consolidated international humanitarian appeal every year (i.e. CAP and its successor, SRP) so far this century.  Humanitarian response in Sudan is largely driven by the consequences that armed conflict has on its civilian population. As the conflict in the Darfur Region heads towards its twelfth year, the humanitarian challenge has never been greater, with record cumulative and new totals of displaced people and rising levels of acute malnutrition. All of this occurs within a context where the capacity of impartial and neutral humanitarian organizations is overstretched and access to affected people is subject to stringent administrative controls and security constraints. 

In this context, the United Nations and partners’ collective humanitarian operation in Sudan (and its HNO and SRP) is delivered in a programme cycle management framework that strives to meet the standards  of:  programme  quality  (e.g.  impartial  assessments);  accountability  (e.g.  stakeholder consultation  and  accountability);  “rights  up  front”  (e.g.  protection  of  civilians  and  aid  workers); conflict and environmentally sensitive; and resilience, early recovery and transition to development. The latter “resilience” standard requires that “humanitarian response is undertaken in a manner that is sympathetic to long-term development objectives, that strengthens the resilience of households and communities  wherever  possible,  and  that  helps  the  transition  through  early  recovery  to  durable solutions”. 

The United Nations and partners have agreed on the strategic objectives for SRP 2015 as follows: 

- save lives of vulnerable people affected by conflict and disaster; 
- protect conflict-affected populations from violence, neglect and exploitation; 
- reduce food insecurity and malnutrition below emergency levels across Sudan; and 
- strengthen resilience and facilitate durable solutions for conflict affected people, including integration and voluntary return. 

There  are  11  individual  sector  response  plans  within  the  Sudan  SRP,  namely:  (i)  education; (ii) emergency   shelter   and   non-food   items;   (iii)   food   security   and   livelihoods;   (iv)   health; (v) nutrition;  (vi)  protection;  (vii)  recovery,  return  and  reintegration;  (viii)  refugee  multisector; (ix) water,  sanitation  and  hygiene;  (x)  coordination  and  common  services;  and  (xi)  logistics  and emergency  telecommunications.    The  11  sectors  in  Sudan  in  turn  plan  a  set  of  complementary activities under each of the four aforementioned strategic objectives. Key priority actions for 2014 Sudan SRP included: 

- improving emergency preparedness and responding promptly to new crises of displacement; 
- addressing the extremely high levels of malnutrition and tackling the underlying public health issues driving these; 
- enhancing the security of conflict-affected populations; 
- facilitating better access to essential services in camps and host communities; 
- reducing food insecurity and increasing household economic autonomy; and 
- re-establishing humanitarian presence in currently inaccessible areas of South Kordofan, Blue Nile and the Darfur Region, initially to achieve comprehensive vaccination coverage. 

28 

The 2014 Sudan SRP identified a total of 6.9 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan, i.e. nearly 20 percent of the country’s total population and a 56 percent increase over the 4.4 million people in need in 2013. The 2014 SRP sought USD 982 million for 419 projects (covering all 11 sectors) throughout Sudan. 

3. **Food Security and Livelihood Cluster/Sector** 

The  United  Nations  Food  Security  and  Livelihood  (FSL)  cluster/sector  strategic  response  plan contributes towards increased food security, reduced malnutrition rates and strengthened livelihoods. The sector seeks to save lives and improve the dignity and well-being of the targeted populations through meeting immediate food needs; improved food availability, access and diversity; economic self-reliance; and environmentally sustainable activities. The sector response plan will guide partners in planning and implementing their activities in sector-defined and prioritized geographic areas (by states and localities). 

The sector objectives contribute towards two of the four strategic objectives of Sudan SRP 2015, namely: *(i) saving lives of vulnerable people affected by conflict and disaster; and (ii) reducing acute food insecurity and malnutrition below emergency levels across Sudan.* Sector activities will address targeted beneficiaries’ immediate life-saving humanitarian needs whilst strengthening resilience and restoring/reconstructing  livelihoods  of  affected  populations  to  cope  with  future  emergencies  and shocks. Emphasis is put on promotion of both gender and environment mainstreaming in partners’ projects,  ensuring  that  planned  activities  are  actually  implemented  on  the  ground  through  active monitoring. During monitoring, beneficiaries’ perception of the assistance and support (in terms of quality, quantity and timeliness) provided by partners is assessed and feedback provided to partners in order to improve on future support. 

The FSL sector in Sudan seeks to alleviate suffering among affected populations through effective coordination of multiple assistance efforts. The sector is co-led by FAO and WFP and works with all stakeholders with an interest or activity in food security and livelihoods, including relevant agencies of  the  Government  of  Sudan,  other  United  Nations  agencies,  international  and  national  NGOs, academic and research institutions and the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement. 

The  FSL  sector  coordinates  current  and  planned  food  security  and  livelihood  interventions,  and disseminates  relevant  information  to  partners.  It  strengthens  preparedness  and  response  to  food security  and  livelihood  emergencies,  while  promoting  capacity  building  of  partners.  The  sector supports people with food assistance and productive livelihood inputs in areas to which people have fled, as well as in areas where people have returned and have access to land for cultivation. As well as environmental impacts, food insecurity amongst returnee populations may also put certain women, girls, boys  and  men  at risk of  sexual exploitation  and  abuse and  gender-based  violence.  It  is the responsibility of the sector partners to ensure these “cross-cutting issues” are considered. The FSL sector also works closely with the Nutrition, Health, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, and Protection sectors  in  planning  and  organizing  assessments  and  sharing  information  on  sector activities/interventions. 

FSL sector coordination operates at both national and state levels, and the work of the partners in 2015 is based on the “Sudan United Nations and Partners’ Humanitarian Work Plan”, in which the sector objectives are to: (i) reduce acute food insecurity and save lives of vulnerable people affected by conflict and natural disasters; (ii) restore and improve food and livelihood security of vulnerable households   in   affected   areas;  and   (iii)   strengthen   FSL   sector   coordination   and   information management for effective and timely humanitarian response.

4\. FAO'S  APPROACH FOR RESILIENT LIVELIHOODS  TO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN SUDAN

![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.014.jpeg)

**4. FAO’S APPROACH FOR RESILIENT LIVELIHOODS TO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN SUDAN** 

1. **FAO’s Strategic Framework** 

In 2010, FAO realigned its core business towards a new “strategic framework”, to be implemented through an initial plan of action for renewal. The Vision included in FAO’s Strategic Framework 2010-2019 is that, “*by 2020, we will be living in a world free of hunger and malnutrition where food* *and  agriculture  contribute  to  improving  the  living  standards  of  all,  especially  the  poorest,  in  an economically, socially and environmentally  sustainable  manner*”.  In this  context, the  Members  of FAO have agreed on three **Global Goals** for the Organization, namely: 

1. eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition, progressively ensuring a world in which people at all times leave sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets dietary need and food preferences for an active and healthy life; 
1. elimination of poverty and the driving forward of economic and social progress for all, with increased food production, enhanced rural development and sustainable livelihoods; and 
1. sustainable management and utilization of natural resources, including land, water, air, climate and generic resources for the benefit of present and future generations. 
1. **FAO’s Strategic Objectives** 

In order to achieve its Vision, FAO has defined five **Strategic Objectives (SOs)**, namely: 

**SO1 – Contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.** 

**SO2 – Increase and improve provision of goods and services from agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a sustainable manner.** 

**SO3 – Reduce rural poverty.** 

**SO4 – Enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems at local, national and international levels.** 

**SO5 – Increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises.** 

The  Strategic  Objectives  focus  on  where  **FAO  can  best  assist  Member  States  to  achieve sustainable impacts in addressing the challenges and opportunities facing food, agriculture and rural  development**.  They  represent  a  combination  of  interlinked  and  cross-sectoral  impacts, addressing the areas of crops, livestock, fisheries, food safety, forestry, natural resources, enabling environments, food security, gender, emergencies and investment. FAO has subsequently prepared a global  Programme  of  Work  comprising  Action  Plans  for  each  of  the  Strategic  Objectives.  The outcomes and outputs of the Actions Plan provide a results-based monitoring matrix for coordinating the  Organization’s  Regional  Priority  Areas/Initiatives  and  individual  Country  Programming Frameworks (Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3) – where the proposed PoA for Sudan is of direct relevance. 

In addition to the areas of work identified for each Strategic Objective, two **cross-cutting themes** have been developed so as to ensure that their respective perspectives are fully integrated into the Organization’s Programme of Work: (i) the integration of **gender** issues in all aspects of its work; and (ii) the importance and diverse contributions of good **governance** across all SO outputs. 

Furthermore, and in line with the methodology of managing for SO outputs, an **additional Objective (“No. 6”)** will cover the provision of **technical quality, knowledge and services** for the work of the Organization, encompassing core normative work. In this context, functional objectives will provide the  enabling  environment  for:  outreach;  information  technology;  FAO  governance,  oversight  and direction; and administration. 

33 

2. **FAO’s Regional Initiatives** 

In 2014, FAO’s Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa (RNE), which covers Sudan, **defined three Regional Initiatives**[^14], namely: 

1. **Sustainable Small-scale Agriculture for Inclusive Development.** 
1. **Building Resilience to Enhance Food Security and Nutrition.** 
1. **Water Scarcity.** 

The Regional Initiatives are a way to support the national policies and programmes of Member States, such as Sudan, through the delivery of products and services from across the results frameworks of FAO’s five Strategic Objectives in an integrated and coordinated manner – involving contributions from services across the Organization (i.e. headquarters, regional, subregional and country offices), structured around significant policy processes and CPFs. Further details are provided in Annex 3.1. 

FAO has selected Sudan as a  model  country for piloting/demonstrating its Regional  Initiative for “Sustainable Small-scale Agriculture for Inclusive Development” – to be interwoven by the second Regional Initiative for “Building Resilience to Enhance Food Security and Nutrition”. 

3. **Sudan Country Programming Framework (2012-2016)** 

The **Sudan CPF**, which is co-owned by FAO and the Government of Sudan (through its Ministries of Agriculture  and  Irrigation;  of  Livestock,  Fisheries  and  Rangelands;  of  Environment,  Forests  and Physical Development; and of Water Resources and Electricity), presents the broad commitment of the Organization, subject to the availability of the required funding, to assist the Federal and State Governments  in  their  efforts  to  achieve  their  own  national  and  state  development  objectives  for agriculture,  food  and  nutrition  security  and  NRM,  as  identified in  the  Interim  Poverty  Reduction Strategy Papers I and II (2011-2016), the Second National Five-Year Development Plan (2012-2016), the   Three-Year   Economic   Crash   Programme   (2012-2015),   the   Second   Agricultural   Revival Programme (2012-2016) and the 18 States Five-Year Development Plans (2012-2016). The CPF also supplements and contributes to the current UNDAF (2013-2016), as well as its predecessor: UNDAF (2008-2012). The CPF identified **four priority areas (*and five outcomes and 15 outputs*)**, namely: 

**Priority  Area  1.   Capacity   building  and  consolidation   of   policy,  laws,  planning   and information institutions; system and mechanism reforms; and development in agriculture, forestry, fisheries of Sudan.** 

**Priority  Area  2.  Capacity  building  of  agricultural  research,  technology  and  knowledge development and transfer for enhanced productivity, production and improved institutional competitiveness, systems and mechanisms in agriculture, forestry, fisheries in Sudan.** 

**Priority  Area  3.  Capacity  building  of  natural  resource  development  and  conservation institutions, systems and mechanisms in agriculture, forestry and fisheries in Sudan.** 

**Priority  Area  4.  Capacity  building  of  the  disaster  risk  management  (DRM)  institutions, systems and mechanisms in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries in Sudan.** 

Further details of CPF outcomes and outputs are provided in Annex 3.2.

4. **FAO’s Programme for Agricultural Recovery, Reconstruction and Development in the** **Darfur Region (2014-2019)** 

In June 2013, the FAO Representation in Sudan and its Headquarters’ Emergency and Rehabilitation Division, with technical support of RNE’s Task Force for the Darfur Natural Resources Programme, mobilized a multidisciplinary mission to develop a fully-fledged programme of project proposals to support the recovery, reconstruction and development of the agriculture sector in the Darfur Region consistent  with  Pillars  I,  II  and  III  of  DDS.  The  main  output  of  the  mission  was  a  programme document that covers six key supportive and interlinked agricultural themes of Pillars I, II and III of DDS  over  the  short,  medium  and  long  terms,  viz:  (i)  capacity  development  and  reconstruction; (ii) crop  production  and  productivity;  (iii)  livestock  production  and  productivity;  (iv)  value  chain development;  (v)  conflict  prevention  (land  use  and  access  to  natural  resources);  and  (vi)  natural resource management – all targeting vulnerable groups, including IDPs, refugees, returnees and host communities in the states of Central, East, North, South and West Darfur, as well as government and private sector agricultural support service providers. 

The  overall  development  goal  of  the  **“Darfur  Agricultural  Recovery,  Reconstruction  and Development Programme”** is to support DDS in “the establishment of a comprehensive system for economic recovery, development, planning and financial management that ensures the sustainability of  the  Strategy  beyond  its  six-year  implementation  period”  with  specific  reference  to  food  and agriculture, rural livelihoods and natural resources. 

The Programme is comprised of one “capacity development” subprogramme that interconnects with three model investment projects – all with short-term (one to two years), medium-term (three to four years) and long-term (five to six years) dimensions[^15], namely: 

1. **Capacity   Development   Subprogramme.

The total cost of the six-year Programme is estimated at USD 146.4 million, of which USD 45.5 million is earmarked for the short term. 

2. **Resilient Lens to Sustainable Agriculture, Food Security, Nutrition and NRM in Sudan** 

The  humanitarian  and  development  agendas  in  Sudan  have  grown  closer  as  the  complex  and protracted  crisis  continues  and  the  linkage  between  the  resulting  humanitarian  suffering  and  the prevalent underdevelopment of the country have become increasingly intertwined. It is inevitable that a population mostly dependent on natural resource-based livelihoods and suffering from chronic and acute  food  insecurity,  malnutrition  and  poverty  will  suffer  more  from  the  impacts  of  additional shocks, climate change and variability and environmental and economic decline. 

Sudan  is  characterised  by  a  risk-prone  environment  which  includes  different  types  and  often concomitant shocks (and stresses – depending on the acuteness of the event), including natural (e.g. prolonged  dry  spells  and  droughts,  torrential  rainstorms  and  floods,  sandstorms,  wildfires  and transboundary plant and animal pest and  diseases); manmade (i.e. conflict and displacement); and socio-economic  (e.g.  escalating  food  and  input  prices)  –  all  compounded  by  deforestation,  land degradation, limited access to land for the poorest populations, conservative cultural norms and loss of  biodiversity.  The  recurrence  of  multiple  shocks  and  stresses  has negative  effects  on  food  and nutrition security and the natural resource-based livelihoods of people, while eroding their capacities to withstand and cope with future shocks. 

Generally,  dealing  with  natural  and  man-made  recurrent  shocks  has  resulted  in  high  levels  of humanitarian spending which, whilst providing immediate relief, has not addressed the root causes of such crises. Therefore, in such contexts, while humanitarian responses remain of crucial importance, there  is  consensus  on  the  need  to  fully  address  the  underlying  causes  of  crises,  which  are  often complex and long term in nature. Against this background, the concept of resilience has emerged as a viable framework for integrating humanitarian and long-term development initiatives. Resilience is generally defined in terms of the capacities of individuals, households, communities and countries to absorb  shocks,  adapt  to  a  changing  environment  and,  in  a  longer-term  perspective,  contribute  to transform the related institutional environment. 

Resilience therefore provides FAO with a framework for addressing, in a unified and sustainable manner, the acute and chronic causes of food and nutritional crises – while helping vulnerable people increase their incomes, access infrastructures and basic social services and build wealth by sustainably 

36 

strengthening their livelihoods and creating a more conducive institutional environment. To achieve these goals, resilience programming is developed according to **four interconnected and mutually reinforcing  pillars**  working at  all  administrative  levels  and  serving  most  vulnerable  communities through the appropriate institutional levels depending on the existing capacities and partners, namely: 

**Pillar 1** aims at building and implementing legal, policy and institutional systems and regulatory frameworks for disaster and crisis risk management for agriculture, food and nutrition. 

**Pillar 2** aims at delivering regular information and trigger timely actions against potential, known and emerging threats to agriculture, food and nutrition. 

**Pillar 3** applies prevention and impact mitigation measures that reduce risks and vulnerability for agriculture, food and nutrition at household and community levels. 

**Pillar 4** support countries and regions affected by disasters and crises with impact on agriculture, food and nutrition to prepare for, and manage, effective responses. 

Resilience programming is based on the concept of creating capacities at all levels (i.e. household, community and institutional) to deal with shocks in a proactive and preventive manner. The specific capacities embedded  in  the  concept  of  resilience are:  (i)  the ability to  recover  after a  shock (the “absorptive” capacity); (ii) to adapt to a changing environment (the “adaptive” capacity); and (iii) to transform an enabling institutional environment (the “transformative” capacity). Understanding and investing in these capacities is expected to help communities to anticipate, prepare for and deal with shocks  of  a  recurrent  and  prolonged  nature.  It  is  therefore  important  to  understand  what  factors contribute to resilience in order to strengthen them by providing the evidence for more effectively designing, delivering,  monitoring and evaluating assistance to populations in need, based on their most  pressing needs. The measurement  and analysis of household resilience to food insecurity in Sudan[^16] was based on the FAO “Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA)” model[^17]. 

The findings of this analysis show the differences in the resilience of households according to their geographical location (e.g. regions and rural/urban areas) and type of livelihood. In this regard, it is noted that household resilience to food insecurity is mainly influenced by household income and food access.  This  highlights  the  need  to  promote  income-generating  activities  as  an  important  policy instrument  in  the  effort  to  improve  household  resilience  to  food  insecurity  and  malnutrition. Moreover, findings indicate that another key limiting factor to household resilience in rural areas is their  access  to  agricultural  and  productive  assets.  Therefore,  policy  should  be  geared  towards agricultural  intensification  and  diversification  that  will  enhance  productivity  and  production.  This includes, for example, the promotion of new and improved climate-smart technologies and practices, reduction of post-harvest losses and increased added value and investment in irrigation schemes (and similar rural infrastructure). Moreover, irrigation could help to diversify income sources to high-value crops and enhance household resilience. Additionally, provision of credit incentives, with the aim of increasing agricultural productivity of local farmers, could help to increase average income of the households and hence their resilience to food insecurity and malnutrition. 

Furthermore, the study found that households in Khartoum and northern, central and eastern regions of the country are more resilient to food insecurity than households in Kordofan and Darfur regions. This is due to very low access to basic facilities (e.g. education, health and markets), productive assets (e.g. land and water) as well as food and income and food in the former regions. Therefore, resilience programming and related investments should try to address these gaps. The analysis by residential areas (i.e. urban and rural) has also indicated that urban households are more resilient than rural 

37 

households as the urban areas have better access to food and income, to basic services and to non- agricultural productive assets. 

Against  this  background,  the  CFP/PoA is  designed to  address  food security- and  nutrition-related issues in a resilient perspective. In particular, the relevant priority elements and cross-cutting actions are reflected in the specific objectives of the PoA, as they are mainly contributing to the overarching outcome  of  reducing  food  insecurity  and  malnutrition  and  diversifying  incomes  to  increase  the resilience of vulnerable landless, marginal and small-scale farmers and pastoralists. More precisely, efforts will focus on: 

- evidence-based  agricultural  policy  development  supported  by  adequate  food  and  nutrition information systems; 
- enhanced agricultural production of smallholder farmers or households and rural communities to harvest respective crops, animals, trees, fish, etc.; 
- access to key productive natural resources; and 
- livelihood protection and recovery – with capacity development, food-based nutrition, gender equality, peace and stability building and PPPs as cross-cutting themes (Chapter 5). 

Addressing malnutrition in rural areas of Sudan requires complementary multisectoral strategies and approaches  that  respond  both  to  the  short-term  immediate  needs  and  the  longer  development challenges.  The  agriculture  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  improving  people’s  nutrition  by increased availability, affordability and consumption of diversified diets and safe and nutritious foods, aligned with dietary recommendations and environmental sustainability. 

Like sustainable development, “resilience” has many dimensions which are reflected in the new FAO strategic  framework  and  its  five  Strategic  Objectives,  i.e.  policy/institutional  (under  SO1),  agro- ecological and service delivery (SO2), rural poverty and social safety nets (SO3), value chain and economic (SO4) and disaster risk reduction (DRR)/risk and crisis management (SO5) (Section 4.1.1). Consequently, resilience to shocks and stresses is a central element in the proposed Plan of Action, and is a pre-condition for the sustainable recovery and development of vulnerable smallholders in Sudan – cutting across and contributing to all five Strategic Objectives (Figure 1).

3. **FAO’s Good Practices in Sudan’s Agriculture Sector** 

Over the past decade, FAO Sudan – in partnership with government agencies and institutions (such as those from MoAI, MoLFR and MoEFPD) and civil society organizations (e.g. academic institutions, NGOs and farmer/pastoralist/fishers’ organizations) – has implemented a series of national, regional and  global  humanitarian  relief,  livelihood  protection/recovery  and  agricultural  development programmes  and  projects  (on  behalf  of  the  Government  of  Sudan,  development  partners  and  the Organization itself) from which **lessons have been learned** that are key to the formulation of the CPF/PoA for Sudan. Such programmes and projects include: 

- European  Union-funded  and  FAO-implemented  capacity  building  component  of  the  “Sudan Productive Capacity Recovery Programme (SPCRP-CB)” (2007-2012; EUR 19 million); further details are provided in Annex 3.3. 
- European Union-funded and FAO-implemented “Sudan Institutional Capacity Programme: Food Security Information for Action (SIFSIA)” (2007-2012; EUR 10 million); and its successor, the “Food  Security  Policy  and  Strategy  (FSPS)  Capacity  Building  Programme”  (2012-2015; EUR 8.6 million); further details are provided in Annex 3.3. 
- FAO/TCP-funded “Demonstration of Improved Water Management and Control Practices for Increasing Agricultural Productivity in the Rainfed Areas” (2010-2013; USD 500 000). 
- FAO/TCP-funded  “Surveillance  and  Diagnosis  of  Foot  and  Mouth  Disease”  (2011-2014; USD 491 000). 
- Government of Canada-funded and FAO and UNIDO-implemented “Integrated Food Security Project (IFSP) in Kassala State” (2012-2016; USD 5.92 million [*FAO component*]). 
- United  Nations’  Darfur  Community  Peace  and  Stability  Fund  (DCPSF)-funded  and  FAO- implemented  “Increasing  Cooperation  between  Conflicting  Communities  through  Promoting Dialogue and Enhancing Livelihoods and NRM in North and West Darfur States” (2009-2014; USD 2 million). 
  - Codex Trust Fund-funded and joint FAO/World Health Organization (WHO)-implemented “Mycotoxin in Sorghum Project” (2013-2014; USD126 877). 
- FAO/TCP-funded “Technical Support for a Comprehensive Agricultural Census” (2013-2014; 

  USD 398 000). 

- FAO/TCP-funded “Development of a Quality Seed Production System and Value Addition in Sudan” (2014-2016; USD 370 000). 
- UK/DFID-funded “Joint Resilience-Building Project in Kassala” (2014-2016; USD 5.8 million) 

  – implemented jointly with UNICEF and WFP. 

- FAO/TCP-funded  “Technical  Assistance  to  Support  Food  Security  and  Livelihoods  of  the Pastoralist Groups in West Kordofan, Sudan” (2014-2015; USD 500 000). 

Since 2003, FAO Sudan has implemented an “emergency relief and rehabilitation programme” (worth in  excess  of  USD  200  million)  –  funded  by  various  bilateral  and  multilateral  humanitarian  and development partners – that has been providing extensive support to, not only humanitarian relief and livelihood  protection and recovery  for  vulnerable  households  in  the  crops,  livestock,  forestry and fisheries subsectors, but also to NRM and other related livelihood resilience-building interventions. These have been implemented primarily across three conflict, drought and pest- and disease-affected regions  of  Sudan,  viz:  (i)  Darfur  (i.e.  Central,  East,  North,  South  and  West  Darfur  States); 

2) Transitional Areas (i.e. Abeyei and Blue Nile, Southern Kordofan and White Nile States); and 
2) eastern Sudan (i.e. Gedaref, Kassala, Red Sea and Sinnar States) – and more recently in Northern and North Kordofan States. The Organization has implemented its emergency relief and rehabilitation 

operations from a central unit based at the FAO Representation in Khartoum, Sudan, and 11 field offices located in the respective states and regions. 

Annex 3.4 provides a portfolio of FAO’s current projects, including “hard” and “soft” pipeline project proposals – the more relevant of which are inclusive to the CPF/PoA for Sudan. 

39 

Several **good practices**[^18]  have been tested and validated by the actors and beneficiaries of FAO’s humanitarian  relief,  livelihood  protection/recovery  and  agricultural  development  programmes  and projects and are therefore recommended for replication and up-scaling by government agencies and civil  society  organizations  (CSOs)  and  sharing  and  adoption  by  greater  numbers  of  smallholder farmers,  pastoralists,  fisherfolk  and  tree-dependent  communities  under  interventions  proposed  by CPF/PoA for Sudan[^19], namely: 

- **Capacity development of government institutions**, including agricultural and animal resources research centres, federal and state-level food security technical secretariats, state-level training units and agricultural extension services, regional-level seed multiplication units and university agricultural and forestry faculties (Annex 3.3). 
- **Food security information systems** for more inclusive and better integrated and informed **food security decision making and policy development** at federal and (Blue Nile, Gedaref, Kassala and Red Sea) state levels, including “**IPC**” **–** a tool for improving food security analysis and decision-making by means of a standardized scale that integrates food security, nutrition and livelihood information into a statement about the nature and severity of a crisis and implications 

  for strategic response (Annex 3.3). 

- **Control  of  transboundary  animal  and  plant  pests  and  diseases**  –  through  surveillance, monitoring, reporting and early warning systems, vaccination campaigns and integrated pest and disease  management  (IPM)  measures  –  linked  to  regional  and  global  networks  (e.g.  FAO’s Emergency  Prevention  System  for  Transboundary  Animal  and  Plant  Pests  and  Diseases (EMPRES), Emergency Centre for the Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD), Emergency Centre for Locust Operations and the Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust. 
- **Community  animal  health  workers  (CAHWs)  –  t**he  CAHW  delivery  system  has  been promoted  and  expanded  by  FAO  and  NGOs  in  collaboration  with  the  State  Ministries  of Agriculture and Animal Resources and their public veterinary authorities due to weakening of the conventional  veterinary  services.  Delivery  of  animal  health  services  through  the  community- based approach was found to be the most appropriate system in the remote areas. CAHWs have been trained and equipped and facilitated the organization of vaccination campaigns. Despite the widespread insecurity, four to five million heads of animals are vaccinated annually in Darfur Region,  with  the  support  of  humanitarian  actors  using  CAHWs  operating  as  free  service providers under strict public supervision. 
- C**ommunity  animal  resources  development  (CARD)  services**  –  a  model  for  providing participatory   holistic   livestock   development,   including   community-based   primary   animal healthcare,  animal  production  (i.e.  feeding,  reproduction,  breeding,  biosecurity,  etc.),  cost recovery of inputs (e.g. feed, minerals and medicines) and surveillance of transboundary animal diseases through trained, equipped and self-supporting community animal resources development 

  associates (CARDAs) (Annex 3.3). 

- **Farmer and pastoral field school (FFS)** group-based approach to adaptive agricultural research and  participatory  learning  and  agricultural  extension,  especially  for  IPM,  on-farm  water management, agroforestry and DRR (Annex 3.3). 
- **Community-based  natural  resource  management**,  i.e.  promotion  of  water  harvesting  (e.g. rehabilitated hafirs and shallow wells), woodlots and agroforestry, fuel-efficient mud stoves and intercropping and crop rotation with legumes for soil fertility management and improved animal fodder (as well as improved household food nutrition) for groups at risk. 
- **On-farm  water  management  (OFWM)**,  i.e.  improved  community  and  farm-level  water harvesting  and  small-scale  irrigation  systems  and  establishment  of  water  users’  groups  for enhanced water management in agro-ecological zones prone to drought and climate variability. 

40 

- **Post-harvest management** – to reduce food losses and add value to agricultural produce through new  and  improved  technologies  and  practices  in  cleaning,  grading,  packaging,  storage, transportation and marketing at the household and community levels – as part of an integrated value chain approach. 
- **Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land in the Context of Food Security (VGGT)** – to promote secure tenure rights and equitable access to land, fisheries and forests as a means of eradicating hunger and poverty, building peace and social stability, supporting sustainable development and enhancing the environment. 

Globally, FAO has generated other good practices which are highly relevant to the agro-ecological and livelihood zones of Sudan and the challenges faced by the country’s agriculture sector and food industries,  e.g.  conservation  agriculture  on  degraded  rainfed  lands  (i.e.  zero  burning  and  grazing, minimum/zero tillage, intercropping of leguminous cover crops, mulching of crop residues and crop rotations); household food nutrition (i.e. diversified diets and improved food preparation and storage); and  food  safety  (i.e.  sanitary/phytosanitary  [SPS]  control,  improved  food  quality  and  safety,  and development and adoption of international food standards). 

4. **FAO’s Comparative Advantage in Sudan** 

In  principle,  the  comparative  advantages  of  FAO  are  derived  from  its  mandate  as  the  lead international agency in agriculture, food security and nutrition. FAO has been a long-term partner of the Government of Sudan on agricultural and food security issues  since Sudan became a member country more than three decades ago. FAO’s strengths in Sudan, which are recognized by both the Government and its development partners, are: 

- its very high level of technical knowledge and experience in agriculture and food and nutrition security  in  the  country  and  globally  –  especially  regarding  international  best  practices  and international standards; 
- its standing as an independent United Nations agency which can act as a neutral broker for the Government and its development partners on difficult and complex issues especially related to policies, institutions and legal and regulatory reforms; and 
- its  ability  to  convene  and  network  with  other  stakeholders  on  agriculture,  food  security  and nutrition matters, including bilateral and multilateral donors, CGIAR centres, international and national NGOs and civil society and private sector organizations present in the country. 

Moreover, the rich knowledge base of FAO in which pools of expertise exist at headquarters and regional levels which can be tapped whenever this expertise is required at country level adds to the comparative  advantage  of  the  Organization.  Within  the  Near  East  Region,  FAO’s  normative  and policy work is carried out by its Regional Office for the Near East and North Africa (RNE) located in Cairo, Egypt. Specialist expertise in all areas covered under the proposed PoA for Sudan is available from FAO’s headquarters in Rome, Italy and RNE. 

FAO  has  been a  key  partner  for  the  Government  of  Sudan  on  many  major agriculture  and  rural development successes. FAO has played a significant role in the development process of Sudan’s agriculture sector supporting a number of programmes and projects that saved lives and promoted the recovery  and  development  of  the  crops,  livestock,  fisheries  and  forestry  subsectors  and  natural resource  base.  The  Organization  has  executed  some  580  projects  with  a  value  in  excess  of USD 480 million (of which some 40 percent has been in support of humanitarian relief and livelihood protection and recovery since 2003). 

The experience and standing of FAO therefore make it an essential partner for the Government on the new resilience-based response, protection, recovery, reconstruction and development agenda that have been proposed in the Government of Sudan’s ARP-II, CPP and DDS and 18 States Five-Year Plans for the Agriculture and Livestock Sectors. This is particularly so in post-conflict periods (e.g. in the Darfur  Region)  when  new  relationships  need  to  be  established  between  states  and  regions  and 

41 

between various institutions over agricultural development, NRM, DRM, etc. FAO has recently, or is at present, assisting the state governments of the Blue Nile, Gedaref, Kassala, Red Sea, River Nile and South  Kordofan  with  the  preparation  of  five-year  agricultural  strategic  plans,  food  security  and agricultural extension and agribusiness policies and strategies through SPCRP-CB, SIFSIA and FSPS Programme (Annex 3.3). 

In support of its humanitarian and development efforts, FAO has stepped up its activities in Sudan since 2013 with a focus on food security policy development and information systems, livelihood response,  protection  and  recovery,  food  security  policy  and  information  systems,  post-harvest management, quality seed systems, TADs control, VGGT and peacebuilding and water harvesting as well as stakeholder capacity development (Annex 3.4). FAO is also the current co-lead (with WFP) of the  United  Nations  Humanitarian  Coordination  Team’s  (UNHCT)  Food  Security  and  Livelihood Sector (cf. HNOs and SRPs), pillar co-lead (with the Darfur Regional Authority [DRA]) of Economic Recovery Pillar III for implementation of DDS and alternate chair of the United Nations’ Programme Management Team for DDS. 

FAO’s proven ability to work with bilateral and multilateral donors and local implementing partners makes it the key international partner for the Government on agriculture, food security and nutrition matters,  and  in  humanitarian  relief,  recovery  and  development  operations.  Over  the  past  decade, FAO’s major success stories include significant “good practices” that have been developed through a series  of  one or  more  FAO  and  donor-funded  projects  (Section  4.3).  FAO’s current  and  pipeline development partners are wide-ranging and include the European Union; Governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Qatar, the United Kingdom and the United States of America; the United Nations’ Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF); and the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF).

5. CPF PLAN OF ACTION FOR SUDAN  FRAMEWORK

![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.016.png)



5. **CPF PLAN OF ACTION FOR SUDAN – FRAMEWORK** 

In September  2014, a joint FAO/Government  of Sudan mid-term review of  the CPF (2012-2016) agreed that there was a need to further prioritize the outcomes and outputs of the Framework given its broad range of priority actions (*viz a viz* FAO’s comparative advantage in Sudan), unclear alignment with the evolving country situation (with regard to recent changes of government policy and FAO Strategic Framework’s result chains), inherent lack of synergies and integration between development and emergency interventions and lack of resource mobilization and communication strategies; and prepare  an  action  plan  to  mobilize  resources  and  operationalize  the  revised  priority  interventions accordingly. The PoA would also extend the CPF until 2019, in line with the revised Government of Sudan’s Agricultural Revival Programme and FAO’s Strategic Framework. 

1. **Goal** 

The overall goal of the PoA for Sudan is **“to contribute to the improvement of food security and nutrition and the reduction of rural poverty in Sudan, while supporting the country’s longer- term economic development goals”.** In this context, the PoA is in line with: 

- the Government of Sudan’s I-PRSP (Section 3.2); 
- Outcomes 1, 2 and 3 of UNDAF Pillars 1 and 2 (Section 3.10.1); 
- FAO’s five Strategic Objectives (Section 4.1.1); and 
- MDG 1 to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; while supporting MDG 3 (gender equality and  the  empowerment  of  women),  MDG  6  (reductions  in  child  and  maternal  mortality, improvement in child development and improved resistance to diseases) and MDG 7 (ensure 

  environmental sustainability). 

2. **Objectives** 

The immediateobjective of the PoA for Sudan is **“to address the key challenges of food insecurity, malnutrition and rural poverty in hazard-prone areas of Sudan by strengthening the resilience of  vulnerable  farm  families  through  a  cohesive  programme  supporting  relevant  household livelihood protection and recovery, equitable and sustainable management of natural resources and agriculture development initiatives”.** In this context, the PoA is line with: 

- the Government of Sudan’s Second National Five Years Strategic Development Plan and ARP (Sections 3.3 and 3.5); 
- FAO’s three Regional Initiatives and updated priority areas of the CPF for Sudan (Sections 

  4\.1.2 and 4.1.3); 

- The IGAD-led “Sudan Country Programming Paper – To End Drought Emergencies in the Horn of Africa” (Section 3.7); and 
- DRA’s “DDS” (Section 3.8). 

The  PoA  therefore  aims  to  increase  food  availability  and  accessibility  and  diversify  household incomes in order to decrease the risk of threats and crises faced by landless, marginal and small-scale men  and  women  farmers  over  the  extended  period  of  the  CPF  (2015-2019).  Moreover,  the  PoA prioritizes and promotes interrelated and mutually supporting and sustainable short-,  medium- and long-term  interventions  at  all  levels  (i.e.  household,  community  and  institutional)  that  would ultimately contribute to overcoming the underlying causes of vulnerability in Sudan. 

The PoA is derived from four specificobjectives related to the priority areas of the updated Sudan CPF, namely: 

1. **To  develop  an  enabling  environment  whereby:  (a)  the  Ministries  of  Agriculture  and Irrigation;  of  Livestock,  Fisheries  and  Rangelands;  of  Environment,  Forestry  and Physical  Development;  and  of  Health  can  prepare  policies,  strategies  and  regulatory** 

45 

**frameworks  and  formulate  programmes  and  projects  (and  follow-up  implementation, monitoring and reporting) and operate information management and sharing systems for a reformed and more resilient agriculture sector; (b) FAO can provide more resilience- based coordination of and support to FSL Cluster/Sector of the United Nations’ SRP and the Economic Recovery (as well as the Governance, Justice and Reconciliation and the Infrastructure) Pillars of DDS; and (c) FAO can assist in the required adjustment of and further support to a revised United Nations Development Assistance Framework.** 

2. **To  enhance  the  production,  productivity  and competitiveness  of  the  agriculture  sector (i.e. crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry  subsectors)  and adapt  production and post- harvest technologies and practices to climate change and variability through improved adaptive research systems and participatory extension services.** 
2. **To secure the access and sustainable management of natural resources (i.e. land, water, forests  and  rangelands)  by  pastoral,  agropastoral  and  forest-dependent  communities prone to recurring hazards,  and enhance the protection and recovery of livelihoods of vulnerable  rural  communities  at  risk  to  natural  and  man-made  threats  and  crises  – through improved food and nutrition security and household income generation.** 
2. **To   improve   Sudan’s   capacity   for   preparedness,   early   warning,   controlling   and monitoring  local,  national  and  international  threats  to  the  country’s  food  chains,  in particular  transboundary  plant  and  animal  pests  and  diseases  and  low-quality, contaminated and condemned foodstuffs.** 
3. **Timeframes for PoA Proposed Intervention Areas** 

As an integral part of the updated CPF for Sudan (2012-2016) and as a contribution to the Sudan NAIP and FAO’s Regional Initiatives (2014-2019), the PoA for Sudan has a duration of five years (2015-2019)  and  is  spread  across  three  overlapping/interlocking  tracks/timeframes  (meaning  that tracks do not necessarily have to be sequential and medium- and long-term projects and programmes could start in 2015 – where prepared, approved and funded), as elaborated below.

46 

1) **Rapid Delivery and Immediate Impact Food and Nutrition Security and Livelihoods** **Protection and Short-term Risk-sensitive Agricultural Policy/Strategy Development (*12 to*** ***24 months*)** 

This  track  includes  food  and  nutrition  security  and  agricultural-based  livelihoods’  protection projects and programmes (under, for example, SRP), which would have an immediate impact on families  and  communities  directly  affected  by  protracted  crises  and  climate  change  and variability. This track would seek to support “quick win” interventions that mitigate some of the critical impacts of crises and existing programmes and projects that can be modified to respond to strategic objectives of national resilience plans and roadmaps and development strategies, and scaled up and/or implemented speedily and for which funding resources can be made available. Such  interventions  would  also  complement  and  extend  some  livelihood  resilience-orientated interventions under humanitarian responses (e.g. cash and food for work/rehabilitation of water harvesting and small-scale irrigation infrastructure, distribution of quality seed and hand tools and   provision  of   integrated   homestead/family  farming  packages)   and   would   be  closely coordinated to ensure effective targeting of gaps and needs and prevent relapse over the longer term. 

This  track  also  includes  agricultural  stakeholder  institutional  assessments,  natural  resources assessments and related policy and strategy development, that would enable effective preparation and implementation of projects and programmes funded under the “medium-” and “long-term tracks”,  e.g.  capacity  development  of  MoAI,  MoLFR,  MoEFPD,  Ministry  of  Water  and Environment  (MoWE)  and  Ministry  of  Health  (MoH)  and  civil  society  and  private  sector organizations  supporting  the  agriculture  sector  and  land,  water  and  forestry  development initiatives. 

2) **Medium-term Delivery and Impact for Risk-sensitive Research and Development and** **Institutional Strengthening of the Agriculture Sector (*24 to 48 months*)** 

This track would include medium-sized projects that need longer preparation and implementation time as well as short-term track interventions that are further scaled up in areas affected by the protracted  crisis  and  climate  change  and  variability.  These  should  be  simple  and  lean interventions adapted to the specific circumstances of MoAI, MoLFR and MoEFPD, relevant private sector organizations and affected areas and populations – according to agreed parameters and  mechanisms  for  pooling  grants  from  government  budgets  and  interested  development partners  to  finance  well-targeted  and  sustainable  agriculture,  food  and  nutrition,  income generation/employment  and  natural  resource  management  interventions.  Stakeholder  capacity development is a key cross-cutting parameter of all projects under this track (i.e. government, civil  society  and  private  sector  service  providers  as  well  as  men  and  women  farmers’, pastoralists’ and tree-dependent peoples’ groups and private sector organizations). 

These  interventions  would  have  a  sustained  impact  and  the  potential  to  further  develop agriculture  sector  policy  reforms  prepared  under  the  “short-term  track”  (including  regulatory frameworks)  and  climate-smart  agricultural  technologies  and  practices  for  up-scaling  through participatory  extension  approaches  under  the  “long-term  track”.  However,  where  appropriate, strategies and regulatory frameworks are already in place (e.g. seed systems, gum Arabic and producer  organizations).  Such  research  and  development  projects  could  be  formulated  and started, with immediate effect, in 2015. 

3) **Long-term Delivery and Impact for Rural Livelihoods Recovery and Risk-sensitive** **Agricultural and Rural Development (*36 to 60 months*)** 

   This  track  includes  projects  and  programmes  aimed  at  mitigating  the  impact  of  protracted conflicts and climate change and variability at catchment area, stock route and state levels (such as  extensive  use  and  depletion  of  physical  assets)  strengthening  livelihood  resilience  and institutional  capacities  that  are  nested  within  national  and  state  governments’  development strategies. These interventions would have a sustained development impact and the potential to 

47 

carry out agriculture sector policy reforms prepared under the “short-term track” and climate- smart agriculture technologies and practices tested, validated and replicated under the “medium- term” track. 

These interventions could be funded by international financing institutions and possibly blended with grant financing from multilateral and bilateral donors. The finalization of these programmes and projects will hinge on Sudan’s institutional capacity and political will to enter into sector policy  reform  programmes  while  also  managing  and  reducing  multi-hazard  risks.  However, where  appropriate,  strategies  are  already  in  place  and  new  and  improved  technologies  and practices have been validated in their respective agro-ecological zones (e.g. water harvesting, on- farm water management, post-harvest management, FFSs and CARD services). Such livelihood recovery programmes could be prepared and started, with immediate effect, in 2015. 

This track, although large and ambitious in terms of financial contributions, could be the most promising  in  terms  of  overcoming  the  current  crisis  and  building  national  multidimensional livelihood  resilience  and  agricultural  development  programmes.  It  would  be  possible  to implement individual components of such multidimensional programmes as individual (and less costly) sectoral “medium-term” projects if the Government or development partner so requires – but  this  would  reduce  the  overall  livelihood-resilience  impact  of  the  original  programme concepts. 

The scale and scope of interventions proposed under the PoA have been based, *inter alia*, on three strategic considerations, namely: 

1. There is a need for a realistic dimension of achievable programme/project objectives (especially regarding the number of beneficiaries), given the uncertainty of the scope and duration of the protracted crisis and the limited timelines of 24 months, 48 months and 60 months. 
1. The currently limited and overstretched government and local implementation capacity for the execution of emergency, recovery and rehabilitation projects, especially in more remote areas. 
1. Existing localized crop calendar and transhumant needs have to be respected within any input- related intervention, and therefore represent,  *per se*, a limitation in terms of speediness and number of initiatives to be implemented within a given period of time. 
4. **Intervention Areas** 

The CPF/PoA for Sudan identifies **four strategic intervention areas that mutually reinforce  17 short-, medium- and long-term overlapping/interlocking projects and programmes** in support of the  relief,  recovery  and  development  of  Sudan’s  small-scale  agriculture  sector  over  an  extended period of the CPF (i.e. 2015 to 2019), namely: 

1. **Improved  policy  and  institutional  environment  for  food  and  nutrition  security  and resilience  programming  –  through  capacity  development,  enhanced  coordination  and better informed decision making and knowledge management and sharing systems** (four short-term   projects,   one   medium-term   project   and   two   long-term   programmes;   total: USD 35 million). 
1. **Enhancing  production,  productivity  and  competitiveness  of  the  crops,  livestock  and forestry  subsectors  and agricultural climate change adaptation** (two short-term projects, one medium-term project and one long-term programme; total: USD 40.2 million). 
1. **Natural  resource  management  and  livelihood,  food  security  and  nutrition  response, protection and recovery** (one medium-term project and three long-term programmes; total: USD 107.8 million). 
1. **National,  regional  and  international  control  of  threats  to  Sudanese  food  chains**  (two medium-term projects; total: USD 27.4 million). 

48 

Details of proposed programmes and projects under the PoA are summarized in Table 2 and presented as “project fiches” in Annex 4. Moreover, Annex 5 shows the connect between the outcome and outputs of PoA programmes/projects and  ARP, CAADP, CPP, DDS, UNDAF and FAO Strategic Objectives and Regional Initiatives. 

It should be noted that the elaborated programme/project profiles are not definitive in nature, i.e. once funding interest has been confirmed, working sessions between the respective donors/international financial institutions, relevant government line ministries and FAO would review and fine-tune the proposals in order to reach a common agreement prior to signature, including the scale of financial assistance and support duration, geographical and beneficiaries targeting and implementing partners. Therefore, there is still sufficient flexibility for justified modifications even at a later stage. 

Moreover, the proposed programmes of Intervention Area 1, “Agricultural policy development and strengthening  of  knowledge  management  and  sharing  systems”,  and  the  situation  analyses  of programmes/projects under other intervention areas, would be built on further outputs of the European Union-funded and FAO-implemented “FSPS Programme” (2012-2015; EUR 8.6 million). The overall objective of the Sudan FSPS is *“to assist and support the efforts of the Government to make food security  (and  agricultural  development)  decisions  more  inclusive  and  better  integrated,  informed, implemented and monitored”*. 

The 17 proposed (and 12 ongoing/pipeline) programmes and projects of the PoA all have a “capacity development” and “resilience building” focus (i.e. policy development, knowledge management and sharing,  institutional  strengthening,  technology  transfer,  DRR,  PPPs,  etc.)  that  would  mutually reinforce ongoing and future agricultural investment programmes to be confirmed/identified through the ongoing NAIP process. 

5. **Timelines for Proposed Projects and Programmes** 

The total duration for the CPF/PoA for Sudan is five years, from January 2015 to December 2019. Timelines for the implementation of individual programmes and projects under the PoA are provided in Table 3. It is the nature of the PoA that all proposed short-, medium- and long-term projects and programmes are given the highest priority by the Government of Sudan, DRA and FAO. However, to ensure that institutional reform-focused projects and long-term technical assistance programmes have a prompt start-up and to facilitate optimum FAO technical and operational support throughout, the timelines for some PoA interventions have been slightly staggered.

* Potential for implementation as discreet projects if targeting and funding limits require, but the respective programmes/projects would lose part of their multisectoral resilience focus 

55 

6. **Cross-cutting Actions** 

There are four cross-cutting actions which would support the four PoA intervention areas and their 17 programmes/projects  (Section  5.4),  namely:  (i)  stakeholder  capacity  development;  (ii)  food-based nutrition; (iii) gender equality; and (iv) peace, stability building and voluntary guidelines for land tenure. 

1. **Stakeholder Capacity Development** 

In Sudan capacity development is a critical issue that has consistently emerged as a top priority in implementing agricultural development projects and programmes in Sudan effectively. The political and economic situation has resulted in capacity gaps of institutions and non-state actors, particularly in the field of food security and nutrition and CCA which results in the need to focus on capacity development  interventions  and  to  increasingly  support  stakeholders  at  state,  locality  and  village levels. 

In the past, development assistance focused mainly on the transfer of knowledge, resulting in the transfer of blueprint solutions from one region, country or focus group to another. This has sometimes contributed to the successful application of ready-made solutions, but not necessarily to strengthen the abilities of the national and local systems to analyse their situations and develop suitable solutions. Capacity development interventions have been identified as key activities for most programmes and projects proposed by the PoA for Sudan. FAO would therefore support stakeholders across all 17 

programmes/projects  according  to  the  Organization’s  **“Capacity  Development  Framework”**[^22]. Under the Framework, FAO, in partnership with internationally and nationally accredited centres of learning  and  institution  building,  would  jointly  assess  and  analyse  existing  situations  in  terms  of capacities  and  identify  the  appropriate  types  of  intervention  for  fostering  the  development  of  the required  capacities  for  individual  programmes/projects  of  the  PoA  –  according  to  the  following dimensions: 

**Three-dimensional Approach:** The new capacity development framework adopted by FAO and its international development partners involves more than just learning, training and knowledge, but a comprehensive three-dimensional approach. It is not enough to train individuals as even organizational capacities are needed to manage and sustain knowledge and change. In addition, issues related to the enabling environment are addressed, such as food security, resilience and seed policies, policy processes and the institutional setup for food security, livelihood resilience and seed systems. For instance, the capacity development approach adopted by the European Union-funded  and  FAO-implemented  “FSPS  Programme”,  comprehensively  involves  the individual,  organizational  and  enabling  environment  dimensions,  and  aims  to  make  real  and sustainable change possible. 

**Country Leadership:** National and local actors, both state and non-state, take a lead role in the process of enhancing their systems, structures and institutions. This increases the likelihood that at the end of the programmes/projects, targeted stakeholders will be in a position to sustain the intended  changes.  Country  leadership  and  ownership  is  best  enhanced  by  ensuring  that stakeholders from key institutions (i.e. state and non-state, communities, farmer organizations, etc.) participate in the planning, implementation and monitoring of projects and programmes in their respective states, localities and villages. 

**Context Specificity:** It is also important to remember that there is no easy “one-size-fits-all” solution  for  capacity  development.  Interventions  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  individuals, organizations and enabling environments need to be tailored to the context of each circumstance (e.g. agro-ecological/livelihood zones, subsector requirements and service delivery mechanisms) in question. Context is at the heart of any capacity action and captured in institutional assessment processes to be followed as a basis for designing capacity development interventions. 

56 

**Beyond  Technical  Capacities**:  The  new  capacity  development  approaches  address,  not  only technical capacities, but also “functional” capacities, which are those needed to sustain change. Of particular note, functional capacities include the capacities to share knowledge and to create partnerships  (e.g.  food  security  information  systems,  FFSs,  CARD  services  and  seed  supply systems). 

With respect to strengthening Sudan’s resilience, functional capacities are particularly important in developing the capacities of households, communities and institutions to bounce back after a shock,  to  adapt  to  a  changing  environment,  and  to  transform  an  enabling  institutional environment.  As  another  example,  for  intervention  area  2  of  the  PoA,  research  institutions, extensions  services  (both  public  and  private)  and  producer  organizations  need  to  be  able  to collaborate closely and share information to ensure that technologies and practices are reaching the rural communities. 

**Sustainability  Mechanism:**  The  new  capacity  development  approach  addresses  the  chronic issue  of  sustainability  and  ensures  that  the  effects  of  interventions  are  sustained  over  time. Sustainability is addressed by an ongoing support to national, state and local-level institutions, as well  as  other  stakeholders  such  as  non-state  actors  and  private  sector  organizations  (such  as universities, research institutes, NGOs, producers’  organizations and chambers of commerce), and by prioritizing inclusive processes (e.g. FFSs, CARD services and PPPs). 

Sustainability will also be addressed with the strengthening of academic and training institutions so that training courses in the areas of the four PoA intervention areas can ultimately be provided by Sudanese institutions. Lastly, by promoting the capacities to work in PPPs, the likelihood of interventions lasting over time will increase. 

2. **Food-based Nutrition** 

As mentioned earlier, Sudan is severely impacted by natural hazards, economic crises and high food prices  that  restrict  livelihood  opportunities  and  decrease  rural  households’  purchasing  power. Particularly hard hit are the 2.9 million IDPs, as well as vulnerable resident communities in the Darfur Region, border-states with South Sudan and eastern states of Sudan, where malnutrition levels are alarmingly high, especially among women and children. 

Addressing malnutrition in rural areas of Sudan will require complementary multisectoral strategies and  approaches  that respond both to the  short-term immediate  needs  and  the  longer  development challenges.  The  agriculture  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  improving  people’s  nutrition  by increased availability, affordability and consumption of diversified diets and safe and nutritious foods, aligned with dietary recommendations and environmental sustainability. Through implementation of the  PoA,  FAO  Sudan  will  aim  to  strengthen  the  impact  on  food  nutrition  across  all  relevant programmes and projects through: 

- monitoring and evaluation relevant indicators, tracking and mitigating potential harm; 
- base goals and activities in the context and causes of malnutrition at the local level; 
- target the vulnerable and improve equity through participation, access to resources and decent 

  employment; 

- empower rural women (through participation in women FFSs and CARD services); 
- increase production and reduce post-harvest losses of nutrient-rich foods (through, e.g., FFSs); 
- facilitate diversification of production (through, e.g., FFSs); 
- incorporate  nutrition  promotion  and  education  around  food  and  food  systems  that  build  on existing local knowledge, attitudes and practices (including FFSs and CARD services); 
- improve processing to maintain nutritional value, increase shelf-life, and enhance food safety 

  (e.g. through women FFSs and CARD services); 

- expand markets, particularity for nutrient-rich foods and enhance market access (e.g. through capacity development of producer organizations); 
- collaborate  with  other  sectors  (i.e.  health,  environment,  social  protection,  labour,  water  and sanitation, education and energy); and 

57 

- maintain and improve the natural resource base (through community-based NRM). 

Sudan is currently implementing an integrated multisectoral approach involving four United Nations agencies; namely, FAO, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. This approach aims to respond to the nutrition crisis in Sudan by providing comprehensive lifesaving and recovery nutrition services for populations affected by acute malnutrition. There are two current examples of this approach that could be up- scaled under the PoA for Sudan, namely: 

1. The partnerships between FAO, UNICEF and WFP, presenting a coordinated, holistic approach to addressing malnutrition and food insecurity in Kassala state, eastern Sudan. The project will build on the comparative advantages of the three agencies in order to implement a synergistic set of  activities  that  will  improve  and  strengthen  communal  and  household-level  resilience  in targeted  marginalized  communities,  so  that  they  are  better  able  to  withstand  recurrent  and predictable shocks. This project is designed to reduce the levels of malnutrition and improve food security in targeted communities. Reduction of  malnutrition and improvement  of  their  public health indicators will ensure that the populations will be in a better overall state of health and nutrition to be able to adequately withstand future shocks, whilst improved livelihood support will focus on ensuring that communities will have a sustained surplus of food and income and access to natural resources, which will mitigate the impact of recurring shocks. 
1. The  Second  International  Conference  on  Nutrition  (ICN2)  is  an  inclusive  intergovernmental meeting jointly organized by FAO and WHO that took place in Rome in November 2014. The two main outcome documents of the conference are: (a) the Rome Declaration on Nutrition: a political  commitment  document;  and  (b)  a  Framework  for  Action:  a  technical  guide  for implementation. FAO Sudan was very engaged in this process, including the preparation of the “ICN2 Report for Sudan”. 
1. Collaboration and coordination to scale-up nutrition, for example: 
- In September 2013, six United Nations agencies, including FAO, IFAD, UNFPA, UNICEF, WFP and WHO joined together in Khartoum to address malnutrition in Sudan by signing a memorandum of understanding that set out a framework for achieving the overall goals of collaboration  towards  tackling  malnutrition  in  the  country  by  scaling-up  nutrition interventions  and  reinforcing  joint  efforts  to  strengthen,  coordinate  and  plan  capacity building of national and subnational government actions. 
- Collaboration  and  coordination  with  other  sectors    (e.g.  health,  women  and  children’s affairs,  local  government,  environment,  social  protection,  labour,  water  and  sanitation, education  and  energy)  programmes  (National  Nutrition  Strategy  –  NNS)  and  partners (i.e. government, United Nations agencies, civil society and the private sector) with common objectives and joint strategies is encouraged in order to be mutually supportive and work toward  strategic  coherence  in  policy  and  programming  for  the  government  while simultaneously addressing the  multiple underlying causes of  malnutrition. As a technical agency, FAO will serve as the voice for promoting nutrition-sensitive programmes at the 

  global, regional and national levels. 

3. **Gender Equality** 

It is essential to increase the importance given to gender-based analysis. In particular, it is necessary to identify specific needs and capacities with regard to men, women, boys and girls and the elderly and/or disabled, in order to implement targeted action and strengthen their livelihood resilience in crisis situations. Women play a fundamental role at all levels of Sudan’s food and nutrition systems. They are often responsible for managing the family plot or small homestead gardens and are very much  involved  in  developing  and  cultivating  larger  household  plots.  In  Sudan,  women  are  more vulnerable in the event of crises because of their more limited access to production inputs, especially to credit and inputs (i.e. seeds, fertilizers, SPS products, etc.), as well as land and water. Special attention will be given in the PoA for Sudan to gender division of labour and to address women’s burden identifying labour-saving technologies and income-generating activities. As a result, and in line with an approach which seeks to integrate nutritional support and increase resilience, FAO aims 

58 

to give priority to women in its humanitarian, recovery and development interventions in Sudan over the next five years. 

The   gender   issues   among   host   communities,   IDPs,   refugees   and   returnees   should   also   be acknowledged given that a considerable number are from female-headed households, i.e. widows, women abandoned by their husbands and women whose husbands are in detention. These households are particularly vulnerable. In addition, the gender relations and roles within the IDP, refugee and returnee  families  are  changing,  which  makes  it  possible  to  challenge  some  traditional  attitudes. Careful gender analysis is needed throughout the implementation of the PoA to increase women’s access to resources and services. 

4. **Peace, Stability Building and Voluntary Guidelines for Land Tenure** 

Peace does not require the resolution of the many conflicts which divide nations and communities. Instead,  peace  merely  requires  the  parties  to  recognize  that  violent  confrontations,  and  threats  of violent confrontations, are an expensive, dangerous and ineffective way of pursuing one's interests. It is believed that other strategies involving nonviolent force, political and legal action, exchange and the integrative system are far superior. The concept of “security first” pursued by most conflict-prone nations forget to put a balance between building security apparatus and building  effective institutions of  just  governance  and  implementing  policies  for  economic,  social  and  political  development. Security  alone  cannot  succeed  in  achieving  the  twin  outcomes  of  peace  and  stability  and  state legitimacy before and after conflict. 

The process of achieving sustainable peace and stability in Sudan depends on institutional choices about how to incorporate different actors into transitional and more permanent governance processes within  a  broad  context  of  different  factors  and  dynamics.  Security,  including  the  issues  of disarmament, demobilization and re-integration of rebel combatants and, linked to this, security sector reform, a functioning system of law and order, including questions of redress for past crimes, refugees and  IDP  return  and  reintegration,  a  sound  economic  and  fiscal  policy,  education  reform  and  the incorporation of local and civil society actors all form part of peacebuilding and stability processes and have an effect on both the nature of the state stability and the sustainability of peace within. 

The challenges facing Sudan in achieving peace and stability are basically a lack of sustainable peace within itself in the Darfur and Eastern Regions and South Kordofan and Blue Nile States partially influenced by regional and global interests and exacerbated by United States of America-led trade sanctions, high inflation, high external debt and decreasing foreign currency reserves. At a time of global economic and financial crisis and a major food crisis and famine, especially in East Africa, Sudan’s economic  difficulties,  compounded  by its  political and security problems,  a  humanitarian crisis for which neither the country itself nor its international and regional partners are particularly well prepared is in the making. 

Irrespective  of  all  these  challenges,  over  the  past  decades,  Sudan  has  continuously  responded  to resolving conflicts within and with its neighbours through different peace initiatives that led to the secession of South Sudan and signing of the peace agreement between the Government of Sudan and some of the Darfur rebel groups. Sudan has also spearheaded institutional building in conflict-prone areas with level of autonomy and development initiatives intended to stabilize the conflict-affected states and communities. However, such efforts have been continuously challenged by the following: 

- A lack of strategic vision to develop programmes that support effective peace and stability, durable and equitable economic and social investment among states and communities. 
- Limited  learning  from  past  lessons  and  areas  requiring  adaptation  and/or  expansion,  and proposed innovative approaches for future action across states and communities. 
- Limited efforts to identify institutional challenges and propose options for mutual success that leverage mutual efforts, integrate emerging practices and technologies that can be accomplished within the current resource-constrained environments. 

59 

- Inability to address how cross-cutting issues among states, communities and groups can be addressed by state institutions more effectively. 
- Limited resources and inability to effectively integrate efforts to shape conditions and respond to emerging security, economic, social and political challenges. 

As access to land is often related to social identity, the land rights of certain social groups may be contested in relation to national and ethnic identity, providing a breeding ground for the potential political  exploitation  of  tension. Tenure  issues  are  essentially  political  and  the  object  of  political discourse and tenure relationships are imbedded in and affected by inter-ethnic relationships. Tenure issues are therefore liable to be politicized and political issues are liable to be ethicized. Therefore, through the use of VGGT voluntary processes, practices and principles that neither establish legally binding obligations nor replace existing laws, treaties and agreements inclusively address land-related conflicts in Sudan. 

FAO is further assisting the Government of Sudan to make peace through community-based trust- building initiatives through the lens  of livelihoods protection, policy and institutional reform,  and building and maintaining regional and international partnerships on food security and nutrition that would potentially lead to peace and stability and meet the basic food and nutrition demands of its citizens. Across all intervention areas of the CPF/PoA for Sudan, FAO in partnership with United Nations agencies and CSOs would focus on increasing public awareness, advocacy and services and create employment opportunities to protect and diversify livelihoods and increase rural incomes that are essential to prevent out-migration and further conflict. In this context, the DCPSF-funded and FAO-implemented  project  “Increasing  cooperation  between  conflicting  communities  through promoting dialogue and enhancing livelihoods and NRM in North and West Darfur States” is an ongoing joint peacebuilding initiative that promotes VGGT by different land users and  employment creation for IDPs and youth most vulnerable or at risk of return to violence to become drivers of innovation and economic recovery and contributors to peaceful coexistence – that would be up-scaled under the PoA as a cross-cutting parameter of all resilience-building projects and programmes.

6. THE WAY FORWARD

![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.018.jpeg)



**6. THE WAY FORWARD** 

1. **Programme Coordination** 

FAO will build on the Organization’s continued food and nutrition security, livelihood protection and recovery, agricultural development and NRM work in Sudan and the Near East and North Africa Region and support MoAI, MoLFR, MoEFPD, MoWE and MoH policy development, information management, CCA, post-harvest management and food safety, TADs control and resilience building, as well as stakeholder capacity development by assisting the CPF Steering Committee to: (i) finalize and endorse the CPF/PoA for Sudan in a timely manner (and, in the longer term, NAIP); (ii) establish a  Programme  Coordination  Unit  (PCU)  to  efficiently  and  effectively  manage  implementation  of government and donor-funded programmes and projects targeting the agriculture sector through the PoA (and NAIP); and (iii) secure resources with development partners for implementation of such projects   and   programmes   (again,   including   those   of   the   PoA   and   NAIP).   In   this   regard, implementation of the PoA and PCU operations (and later financing of NAIP) would be in accordance with the policies and regulatory frameworks developed through PoA support to the current ARP-II and a future ARP-III, the current DDS, the 2015 Sudan SRP and a revised UNDAF. 

Considering the scope and magnitude of the PoA that addresses a wide range of priorities related to the agriculture sector in Sudan, including policy development, crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry production,  post-harvest  management,  NRM,  resilience  building  and  stakeholder  capacity development,  a  strong  mechanism  built  in  the  PCU  would  ensure  synergy  and  efficiency  in  the implementation,  coordination  and  monitoring  of  the  respective  projects  and  programmes. Establishment of the PCU within the Federal MoAI in Khartoum28   is therefore a vital element of FAO’s  future  technical  assistance  to  the  Government  of  Sudan  for  ensuring  the  successful implementation of the integrated and multidisciplinary PoA (as well as other agricultural investment programmes and projects under NAIP) over the coming five years. 

The overall aim of the PCU is to assist MoAI, MoLFR, MoEFPD, MoWE, MoH and their respective corporations to ensure that agricultural technical assistance and investment projects in Sudan are well coordinated,  their  integration  with  government,  private  sector,  NGO  and  CSO  stakeholders  is improved  and  all  food  and  agricultural  development  and  natural  resources’  interventions  are integrated under resilient and sustainable approaches, implemented smoothly and objectives are met. To  be  more  precise,  terms  of  reference  for  the  PCU  would  include:  (i)  representation  of  and coordination with the respective ministries, development partners, private sector, NGOs, CSOs and FAO are well established; (ii) formulation of projects is timely executed; (iii) project activities are smoothly  implemented;  (iv)  cross-cutting  actions  are  well  coordinated;  (v)  technical  assistance  is appropriate,  efficient  and  effective,  and  South-South  Cooperation  is  promoted;  (vi)  technical backstopping missions are properly and timely executed; (vii) project reporting is timely executed; and (viii) monitoring and evaluation of project implementation is well executed and followed up. 

2. **Funding Modality** 

As  mentioned  earlier,  the  CPF/PoA  for  Sudan  (and  forthcoming  NAIP)  represent  a  multidonor framework composed of separate integrated programmes and projects “under one umbrella”, giving the opportunity for the Government  of Sudan and United Nations agencies to  prioritize food and agriculture-based livelihood protection, recovery actions and development interventions and potential resource partners to earmark contributions to their own areas of interest and/or add value to their ongoing  investments  in  crops,  livestock,  fisheries  and  forestry  development  and  natural  resource management (Section 6.3). This would make possible coherent management of an array of social risk management,  social  protection,  poverty  reduction,  equity  development  and  safety  nets  insurance efforts with various immediate, near and short-term planning and project cycles to address various ![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.019.png)

28 One possible host for the PCU could be FSTS, hosted by MoAI and already supported by FAO 

63 

underlying themes and issues relating to policy processes, technology, environment, and production and investments to institutions, services, infrastructure, value chains and collective actions. 

FAO will work with the Government of Sudan to finalize and endorse the multidonor PoA which is expected to be presented during donor meetings scheduled for Khartoum in early 2015 (in line with the roadmap for NAIP). In the meantime, FAO would endeavour to assist MoAI in the establishment of  the  PCU  and  to  strengthen  their  association  with  relevant  United  Nations  agencies  and development partners in both Sudan and the Near East and North Africa Region as a whole in order to mobilize further resources for implementation of programmes and projects under the PoA – as well as FAO’s three Regional Initiatives (Section 6.3). It is anticipated that initial funding for the PCU would be  provided  through  financing  of  programme  or  projects  under  intervention  area  1,  “Policy Development and Information Management”, but in particular the proposed Programme 1.3 Capacity Development   for   Evidence-based   Resilience   and   Food   Security   and   Nutrition   Policy   and Programmes”. In the longer term, the PCU could be funded from a technical assistance project in support  of  NAIP.  FAO  has  recently  established  a  similar  modality  for  its  technical  assistance  to agricultural investments in Bangladesh, where the World Bank is the major development partner. 

3. **Strategic Partnerships** 

It  is  acknowledged  by  all  actors  that  no  sectoral  intervention  alone  would  build  resilience  for sustainable development which could only be achieved through complementary actions in relation with the respective mandates and comparative advantages that each actor brings in addressing food insecurity, malnutrition, poverty and land degradation in Sudan from different angles. In this regard, it is worth noting that the CPF/PoA for Sudan, while directly targeting resource-poor men and women smallholder  farmers,  pastoralists  and  tree-dependent  people  with  food  security  and  nutrition  and income-generation interventions, would also be supporting the Government of Sudan to recover its economy and stimulate agricultural growth – both through capacity development initiatives requiring the support of all partners listed below. 

It  is  anticipated that short-term projects focusing on agricultural policy development  and research would be financially supported by FAO and bilateral  donors with specific interests in specialized fields, short- and medium-term projects and focusing on institutional strengthening by bilateral donors with interests in agricultural and rural services, and long-term technical assistance programmes by larger  bilateral  and  multilateral  donors  and  international  financing  institutions  with  interest  in multisectoral resilience, NRM and agricultural growth  – all in partnership with the private sector, NGOs  and  CSOs.  The  complementarities  of  these  actions,  in  properly  and  comprehensively addressing the needs of both resource-poor  men and women smallholder farmers, pastoralists and tree-dependent people with those of less-affected but equally vulnerable rural populations, is essential to  reduce  competition  over  natural  and  economic  resources  and  maintain  social  cohesion.  In  this context, FAO, through the PoA (and NAIP), would facilitate partnerships for food security, nutrition and agricultural development between: 

- government  agencies  (e.g.  Higher  National  Councils,  MoAI,  MoLFR,  MoEFPD,  MoWE  and MoH,  and  their  respective  corporations  and  State  Ministries  of  Agriculture  and  Animal Resources, and DRA) and local authorities; 
- civil  society  (e.g.  academic  and  research  institutions,  NGOs,  CBOs  and  men  and  women farmers’/pastoralists’ unions and cooperatives); 
- the private sector (i.e. consultants, consultancy firms and veterinary doctors and input suppliers, traders, food processors, wholesalers and retailers, exporters, etc. of food value chains); 
- South-South Cooperation (i.e. deployment of short- and long-term specialists from countries such as  Brazil,  China,  Egypt,  India  and  South  Africa  to  facilitate  the  exchange  and  uptake  of development solutions and promote platforms for knowledge networking to develop national and 

  institutional capacities); and 

- development partners (i.e. international financing institutions, donors and agriculture and rural development agencies/implementing partners, some of whom are listed below). 

64 

In line with the Government’s and United Nations agricultural and rural development frameworks and strategies for Sudan, FAO would ensure that **s**trategic partnerships and alliances are created for each of the aforementioned proposed projects and programmes at local, national, regional and global levels in order to share the burden of and encompass the intervention of the widest possible partnerships and knowledge sharing for strengthening the resilience of those most vulnerable rural populations in the country affected by food insecurity, malnutrition, poverty and climate change. The PoA for Sudan, in combination with NAIP, would represent essential agricultural, food, nutrition and natural resources components to the contributions of all partners supporting resilient and sustainable rural livelihoods in the country. Potential partnerships include the following: 

**AfDB**  has  recently  funded  a  USD 30  million  project,  “Drought  resilience  and  sustainable livelihoods programme in the Horn of Africa (DRSLP II) - Sudan component” for implementation by  IGAD.  FAO  is  the  implementing  partner  for  agricultural  research  under  AfDB-supported Sudan’s  Strategic  Plan  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Statistics  (SPARS).  This  initiative  supports reliable, accurate and readily available data on agriculture, which is key in influencing  private sector investment in the sector. 

**Governments  of  Australia  and  Belgium**  *–both  recently  funded  FAO  to  provide  emergency assistance (agriculture and livestock) to vulnerable households in Greater Darfur*. 

**Government of Canada** – *recently supported FAO’s integrated food security project (crops and livestock  production, post-harvest  management  and empowerment  of  men and women farmers’ groups)*, jointly with UNIDO in Kassala. 

**DRA  (and  DCPSF)**  –  *currently  supporting  FAO  in  VGGT  and  peacebuilding  and  water harvesting  projects*  –  for  inclusion  (in  DDS)  and  funding  of  “capacity  development” subprogrammes  and  model  investment  projects  in  “wadi  catchment  development”,  “migratory stock  route  services”  and  post-harvest  management/value  chain  development”  under  FAO’s proposed “Programme for Agricultural Recovery, Reconstruction and Development in the Darfur Region (2013-2019)”. 

**EU** – *currently supporting FAO food security policy and capacity development and the United Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  and  United  Nations  Office  for  Project  Services (UNOPS) watershed management programmes* – has confirmed that Sudan would benefit from the forthcoming FAO-implemented Information for Food and Nutrition Security and Resilience for 

Decision Making (INFORMED)  programmes, as  well as the next (11th) EDF (2014-2020); the latter would probably benefit from up-scaling of ongoing EU-funded initiatives such as the FAO- implemented “FSPS Programme” and UNEP and UNOPS-implemented Darfur “*wadi* catchment management projects”. 

**Italian Development Cooperation** – *currently supporting health-related projects in the Eastern Region (including water harvesting, improved seeds and new techniques)* – indicated interest in partnering  with  FAO  in  a  project,  “Building  household  resilience  through  promoting  adapted production  technologies  in  livelihoods  and  natural  resources  management  in  Tokar  and  Haya localities in Red Sea State”. 

**IFAD** *– currently supporting area-based integrated rural development, rural access, traditional rainfed producers, seed development and livestock production and marketing*. 

**IGAD**: FAO is currently supporting the institutional strengthening of the implementation of the IGAD/CAADP Compact to promote private and public investments in agriculture; and FAO and IGAD  are  currently  preparing  “IGAD-FAO  Partnership  Programme  on  Resilience”  whose conceptualization is embedded in IDDRSI, which provides a common framework for government, humanitarian and development partners to build the resilience of populations frequently affected by drought. 

**United   Kingdom   Department   for   International   Development   (UK/DFID)**   –   *currently supporting the joint FAO/UNICEF/WFP resilience building and nutrition project* – has indicated 

65 

that  the  Department  would  continue  supporting  similar  household-based  resilience-building projects in Sudan but also focus on private sector economic development over the coming years – adding that the smallholder agriculture subsector would be a prime “entry point”. 

**UNICEF** welcomed FAO’s partnership in the UK/DFID-funded “Joint resilience-building project in  Kassala”  and  suggested  that  potential  states  for  expanding  the  joint  FAO/UNICEF/WFP approach include the Blue Nile, Red Sea, West Darfur and West Kordofan, where UNICEF has appropriate field teams already on the ground. 

**United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)** facilitates the Sudan Humanitarian Work Plan (HWP) as a key planning and resource mobilization tool for the humanitarian community and is *currently supporting FAO life-saving food security, nutrition and livelihood protection projects through its Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) and Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF)*. 

**USAID**  (and  its  **Office  for  United  States  Foreign  Disaster  Assistance  [OFDA]**)  indicated potential  in  partnering  with  FAO  in  support  of  initiatives  under  CAADP-Sudan  Compact, COMESA  and  African  Union  International  Bureau  for  Animal  Resources  (AU-IBAR)  and resilience building in the Darfur Region, including VGGT and household and community-based post-harvest management/value chain development. 

**The World Bank** is planning a return to supporting the productive sectors of Sudan in 2015 and is seeking  “entry  points”  for  grant  funding  in  the  agriculture  sector,  including  sector  reviews emanating  from  the  forthcoming  Comprehensive  Agricultural  Census  and  recommendations  of NAIP. 

**WFP** and FAO co-lead the FSL Sector in Sudan. They will continue to support the humanitarian coordination role related to food and nonfood asset activities, as developed and agreed under the 2015 SRP and HNO. 

**WHO** and FAO jointly organized the global ICN2 conference in Rome during November 2014 (Section 5.6.2) – with implications for capacity development in food-based nutrition for Sudan. WHO has also shown a keen interest in partnering with FAO on any future “food safety” projects in Sudan given recent success with the joint “Mycotoxin in sorghum project”.

**Annex 3**** 

**FAO’S REGIONAL AND NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE** 

1. **FAO’s Three Regional Initiatives** 
1. **Sustainable Small-scale Agriculture for Inclusive Development** 

The “Sustainable Small-scale Agriculture for Inclusive Development” Initiative will support countries of the Near East and North Africa Region to reduce rural poverty through a cohesive programme addressing small-scale agricultural development. In this context, the Regional Initiative will support an improved policy environment effectively addressing the specificities of small-scale agriculture, to unleash the  potential  of  this  sector to  effectively contribute to  poverty reduction  through  growth, income generation and employment. Through targeted interventions, the Regional Initiative will also aim to support smallholders to sustainably improve productivity, value addition and market access, ensure  better  governance  and  institutions  and  promote  investment  in  small-scale  agriculture  to enhance the dynamics of the agriculture economy, particularly in rural areas. Moreover, the Regional Initiative  will  specifically  address  one  of  the  most  important  structural  challenges  in  the  region, namely high numbers of youth unemployment and gender inequality. 

The Regional Initiative will provide a cohesive framework to better support countries such as Sudan and proposes to address challenges to small-scale agriculture through a three-pronged approach, and in line with FAO’s Strategic Framework, namely: (i) improve the understanding of various typologies of smallholders, their linkages with markets and their barriers in order to support evidence-based policy  and  strategies  and  to  prioritize  interventions  as  well  as  better  target  public  and  private investment  in  favour  of  small-scale  agricultural  development;  (ii)  address  specific  challenges  of small-scale agriculture to sustainably improve productivity, value addition and viability of the sector; and  (iii)  empower  those  engaged  in  small-scale  activities  in  agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries, including strengthening professional organizations and supporting youth and women's employment. 

2. **Building Resilience to Enhance Food Security and Nutrition** 

The primary emphasis of the Regional Initiative on “Building Resilience to Enhance Food Security and Nutrition for the Near East and North Africa” will be on improving policy and governance for food security and nutrition and building resilient food security and nutrition institutions, markets and production  systems  through  improved  coordination  and  integration  of  actions  at  the  subnational, national and regional levels. Within this framework, five areas of actions are considered crucial for the focus of the initiative: (i) strengthening of capacities for developing coherent policy frameworks and investment programme for sustainable food security and nutrition at the national and regional levels; (ii) developing efficient evidence-based food security information and knowledge exchange for decision support systems; (iii) promoting the development of efficient and sustainable food systems with  specific  attention  to  reducing  food  losses  and  waste;  (iv)  promoting  sustainable  access  of households to safe, nutritious and diversified food; and (v) building the resilience of households and communities  and  agro-ecosystems  to  anticipate,  absorb  and  recover  from the  negative  impacts of man-made and natural shocks*.* 

3. **Water Scarcity** 

The “Water Scarcity” Initiative comes in support of FAO member countries of the Near East and North Africa Region in identifying priority areas of action in water management that can significantly contribute to boosting agricultural productivity, improving food security and using water resources in a more sustainable way. The rationale behind the initiative is described in FAO’s Water Report 38: “Coping with Water Scarcity: an Action Framework for Agriculture and Food Security”. The Water Scarcity  Initiative  will  assist  countries  to  identify  and  streamline  policies,  governance  and  best 

74 

practices that can significantly improve agriculture productivity in sustaining their food security. The initiative will serve, complement and add value to the ongoing major policy processes in the region and  will  focus  on  the  following  six  main  areas of  work:  (i)  adopting  a  water-food-energy  nexus approach  to  water  and  food-security  strategic  planning  and  policies;  (ii)  strengthening/reforming governance at all levels; (iii) improving water management, performances and productivity in major agricultural systems and in the food chain; (iv) managing the water supply through reuse, recycling and adaptation to climate change; (v) building sustainability, with focus on groundwater, pollution and  soil  salinity;  and  (vi)  benchmarking,  monitoring  and  reporting  on  water-use  efficiency  and productivity.

3. **FAO Capacity Building Programmes in Sudan** 

In the context of FAO’s Additional Objective of “Technical quality knowledge and services”, FAO’s new “Capacity Development Framework” – an integral part of the Organization’s “Corporate Strategy on Capacity Development”  – is a tool that guides staff of FAO and its partners in analysing the appropriate types of interventions for fostering the development of capacities in countries such as Sudan. The framework is based on the enhancement of technical and functional capacities, which are prerequisite  to  achieving  the  goals  of  FAO  and  its Member  States  (including  CPFs)  across  three dimensions, viz: (i) individual (i.e. knowledge, skills, etc.); (ii) organizational (i.e. public and private sector organizations, civil society organizations, etc.); and (iii) enabling environment (i.e. political commitment and visions, policy, legal and economic frameworks, budget allocations and processes, etc.). Technical capacities enable stakeholders to carry out tasks required to intensify food production sustainably, manage natural resources and eventually to improve food security and safety for all. In addition,  four  functional  capacities  enable  stakeholders  to  plan,  lead,  manage  and  sustain  change initiatives in agricultural and rural development to ensure that technical know-how is embodied in, for example,  agricultural  recovery,  rehabilitation  and  development  in  Darfur  Region,  viz:  (a)  policy development  and  reform;  (b)  knowledge  management  and  information  exchange;  (c)  networks, alliances and partnerships; and (d) planning, implementation and monitoring. 

1. **Sudan Productive Capacity Recovery Programme** 

The  capacity  building  component  of  the  recently  completed  European  Union-funded  and  FAO- implemented the Sudan Productive Capacity Recovery Programme  (SPCRP) (2007-2012; EUR 19 million) is a prime example of FAO’s new Corporate Strategy Framework. The capacity building component  (CB)  of  SPCRP  supported  the  expansion  of  physical  capacity  as  part  of  its  work  to strengthen Sudan’s ability to improve agricultural service delivery in four conflict-affected states, i.e. Blue Nile, Red Sea, River Nile and South Kordofan. SPCRP-CB also supported the strengthening of an enabling environment for agricultural and rural development in Sudan through a comprehensive approach addressing both policy and institutional and human resources levels in the same four states. SPCRP-CB’s **physical and human capacity and institutional development** achievements included: 

- Construction  or  refurbishment  of  State  MoA  and  MoAR  and  Locality  Agriculture  Offices, animal  hospitals  and  pharmacies,  veterinary  laboratories  and  slaughter  slabs,  and  the establishment of plant nurseries. 

77 

- Provision of 32 vehicles, 94 motorcycles, more than 300 bicycles and 60 donkeys to field staff and FFS facilitators for transport to help them reach marginal and small-scale farmers, deliver extension services and carry out surveys and other tasks. 
- Provision of generators, computers and other equipment which enabled state and locality-level staff to carry out their tasks more efficiently and effectively in a modern environment. 
- Support  to  the  development  of  five-year  agricultural  strategic  plans,  agricultural  extension policies and strategies and agribusiness policy for each of the four states. 
- Support to the establishment of marketing units and in the MoAs and MoARs of the four states, whereby a  total  of  16  employees  were trained  on  developing agro-enterprises, value-chain networking  and  financing  and  rapid  agribusiness  appraisal  and  planning;  as  well  as  the establishment  of M&E  units and  coordination units to continue  SPCRP-CB  activities after 

  phasing out of the programme. 

- Establishment of training units in each state ministry to improve the management of plans and enhance  skills  development.  Support  was  also  given  to  enhance  human  capacity  through technical training of trainers and on-the-job training for more than 3 000 government staff. A third of the training participants were women. 

A second subcomponent of SPCRP-CB was the piloting and demonstration of the **FFS group-based approach to adaptive research and participatory learning** – primarily focused at increasing staple food crops and horticultural production in the Blue Nile, River Nile, Red Sea and South Kordofan States.  The  more  successful  and  entrepreneurial  FFSs  were  encouraged  to  graduate/evolve  into producers’ groups and farmers’ associations which, with further empowerment and training, should benefit from greater shared resources, economies of scale and market negotiating power. A total of 222 seasonal FFSs were implemented in the four states, involving more than 5 500 farmers. Strong social and cultural barriers hindered the participation of female farmers in some rural areas. However, the percentage of women participants ranged from 15 percent in the Red Sea State to 50 percent in the Blue  Nile  State.  In  addition,  the  Component  trained  a  total  of  five  FFS  supervisors,  60  master trainers/subject matter specialists and 444 FFS facilitators in the FFS approach and new and improved production technologies and practices to be transferred. The participation of women in these roles ranged from zero to 55 percent across the four states. Groups of master trainers were established to sustain the FFS model beyond the Component’s lifetime. 

Farmers participating in FFSs achieved increases in crop yields of up to 60 percent through improved cropping systems and more diversified agricultural activities on their group experimental plot, e.g. use of crop rotations, chicken manure, ridge cultivation, rainwater harvesting, integrated fish farming, etc. Fifty-five  additional  field  days  were  organized  to  extend  the  learning  of  new  and  improved technologies  and  practices  to  some  11 000  farmers.  Some  78  exchange  visits  between  FFS participants were  arranged,  five  “lesson learned”  workshops  were  organized and  one international study tour was undertaken. 

A third subcomponent of SPCRP-CB was the piloting and demonstration of the **“community animal resources development associates (CARDA)**” model of providing extended livestock development services beyond primary animal healthcare. It is based on a holistic approach (of animal healthcare, feeding, reproduction, breeding, etc.) which addresses the needs of livestock keepers. CARDAs are men  and  women  selected  by  their  respective  communities  to  be  trained  in  animal  resources development services that they can then deliver in their communities. CARDAs primarily operate in remote pastoralist communities and are increasingly offering their skills on a pay-per-service basis, making the CARDA model a sustainable community-based delivery system. 

Some 178 CARDAs from the Blue Nile, River Nile, Red Sea and South Kordofan States have been trained in primary animal healthcare, nutrition, reproduction, marketing and processing of meat and milk.  The  participation  of  eight  women  from  the  River  Nile  and  Red  Sea  was  considered  a breakthrough in these culturally sensitive states. After training, each CARDA was equipped with a bicycle and a medical kit for offering their services to members of their communities. It is estimated 

78 

that  10 000  pastoralists  and  agropastoralists  benefited  from  CARDA  services  during  the  project lifetime. 

A fourth, but less successful, component of SPCRP-CB was to assist **small-scale farmers to form small business groups, access markets and develop rural enterprises** in the Blue Nile, River Nile, Red  Sea  and  South  Kordofan  States.  The  Component  supported  the  establishment  of  42  small business groups with around 25 members each. Most of the groups comprised a mix of men and women,  and  seven  of  the  groups  were  comprised  solely  of  women.  The  groups  were  primarily involved with fishing, food processing, handicrafts and the processing of dairy products, honey, citrus and  poultry  and  received  the  required  training  accordingly.  The  Component  also  conducted  rural marketing assessments in each of the four states. Furthermore, value chain assessments for milk and grapefruit production were conducted in the River Nile State and for fish production in the Red Sea State. 

2. **Sudan  Institutional  Capacity  Programme:  Food  Security  Information  for  Action** **(SIFSIA) and Food Security Policy and Strategy Capacity Building Programme (FSPS)** 

   SIFSIA  was  another  recently  completed  EU-funded  and  FAO-implemented  capacity  development project (2007-2012;  EUR  10  million).  SIFSIA  has  strengthened the  Government  of  Sudan’s  food security information generation, analysis and dissemination through eight main outputs, namely: 

1. Establish  effective  cross-sector  partnerships  for  food  security  through  the  building  and strengthening of stakeholder institutions. 
1. Strengthen government capacity for developing food security policy and interventions through the promotion of food security policy and action. 
1. Government  regularly  undertaking  effective  food  security  analysis  through  integrated  and comprehensive food security analysis. 
1. Government-led   and   sustained   integrated   crop   monitoring,   forecasting   and   production estimation system through integrated agroclimatology analysis. 
1. Strengthen  government-owned  and  led  “food  and  agriculture  market  information  system” through the linking of farmers to markets. 
1. Strengthen government capacity in NRM information system through the mapping of Sudan’s natural resources. 
1. Enhance government’s ability to manage nutrition information monitoring system. 

viii.  Establish  government-owned  comprehensive  food  security  baseline  through  the  survey  of 

Sudan’s households. 

SIFSIA was  successful in laying the  **foundations for  integrated and  coordinated food security information  and  policy  action**  through  intensive  capacity  development  activities  –  including establishment and strengthening of the **Food Security Technical Secretariat (FSTS)** of the Federal MoAI. However, SIFSIA’s support was primarily delivered at the federal level with limited outreach to state-level food security information systems. Support now calls for expanding the scope of SIFSIA at  the  state  level  in  order  to  make  Government  of  Sudan-level  food  security  information  more representative while availing information for target states to make their own decisions. To address the problem of limited or poor linkages between the state- and federal-level decision-making processes and increased transparency, more emphasis will be given to facilitate two-way communication and interaction   mechanisms   through   a   three-year   follow-up   EU-funded   and   FAO-implemented programme (EUR 8.6 million). 

The  outcome  of  the  new  FSPS  programme  is  “food  security  decisions  more  inclusive,  better integrated, informed, implemented and monitored in the states of Blue Nile, Gedaref, Kassala and Red Sea”. The programme will be executed by FSTS with financial and technical support of the EU and FAO. The outcome of the programme will be achieved through five outputs modified/expanded from those of SIFSIA, viz: (i) effective cross-sectoral food security institutional framework and linked to the national institutional framework; (ii) capacity to review plan, budget and monitor food security 

79 

policies  and  strategies  developed,  resulting  in  more  effective  public  action  for  food  security  and nutrition;  (iii)  functional  regional  food  security  information  systems  strengthened  and  support decision making; (iv) food security oriented non-state actors’ capacity strengthened; and (v) key food insecurity drivers are better understood and linked to decision making.

|**Intervention Area 1. Improved Policy and Institutional Environment for Food and Nutrition Security and Resilience Programming – through capacity development,** ||
| - | :- |
|**enhanced coordination and better informed decision making and knowledge management and sharing systems** ||
|||
|**Objective** |<p>To develop an enabling environment whereby: (a) MoAI, MoLFR, MoEFPD, MoWRE and MoH can prepare policies, strategies and regul atory frameworks and formulate programmes and projects and manage information management and sharing systems for a reformed and mor e resilient agriculture sector; </p><p>(b) FAO can provide more resilience-based coordination of and support to the Food Security and Livelihood Cluster of SRP and the Economic Recovery Pillar III of DDS; and (c) FAO can assist in the required adjustment of and further support to a revised UNDAF. </p>|
|<p>**Rationale and Justification:** </p><p>***Information Management and Institutional Assessment*** </p><p>The social, political and economic circumstances of Sudan have changed considerably since the secession of South Sudan in 201 1, in particular the loss of oil revenues and the significant increase in the importance of the agriculture sector for the country’s economic recovery. Despite the promulg ation of poverty reduction and five-year development plans, economic salvation programmes, ARP and DDS since 2011, there remains a lack of up-to-date agriculture and food security data upon which to base sound decision making and policy development for the crops, livestock fisheries and forestry subsectors, natural resource management and a modern food industry. The Government of Sudan is committed to a National Agriculture Census, for which FAO is assisting with preparatory work, includin g sampling frames, questionnaires and data analysis systems. However, such agricultural statistics would require further analysis and reporting to reflect food and nutrition security and resilience -based policy needs. </p><p>The last institutional assessment of the agriculture sector was undertaken by FAO as part of the baselines for the EU -funded and FAO-implemented SPCRP-CB and SIFSIA in 2006, and only then of the Federal MoAI and MoLFR and four State Ministries of Agriculture and Animal resources, namely: B lue Nile, Red Sea, River Nile and South Kordofan.  Given  the  decentralization  of  many  government  agricultural  support  services  (including  agricultural  extension),  the  recent  enactment  of  several  laws liberalising seed systems and gum Arabic production and recognizing more informal “producer organizations”, as well as the abovementioned socio-political and socio- economic changes in the country (including promulgation of DDS), there is a need to repeat this institutional assessment but ac ross a much broader spectrum – including all  government  agencies  (e.g.  MoAI,  MoLFR,  MoEFPD,  MoWE  and  MoH  and  their  respective  corporations), civil  society  organizations  (i.e.  academic  and  research institutions, farmers’ and pastoralists’ unions, cooperative unions, NGOs and CBOs) and private sector organizations and companies (e.g. SBEF and its UoCAP), and at central, regional, state, locality and village levels. </p><p>The current EU-funded and FAO-implemented FSPS Programme addresses key problems, both at the federal and state levels, related to the establishment of an effective and sustainable food security inter-sectoral institutional framework able to address in a sustainable manner key food security problems and its structural causes in a resilience perspective. Key gaps to be addressed through this initiative include: (i) inadequate understanding of key drivers of food security and vulnerability; (ii) poor sustainability of food security and nutrition information systems and related weak capacities of national and state instituti ons; and (iii) inadequate links between food security and resilience analysis and related decision making. Based on the successful experience of FSPS Programme in four states (i.e. Blue Nile, Gedaref, Kassala and Red Sea) and related capacity assessment, DRA and MoAI have proposed to expand the initiative to cover the remaining 14 states of Sudan (including Central, East, North, South and West Darfur – under DDS). This expanded programme will be at the core of CPF/PoA because it is designed to create capacities and to inform all the food security and resilience investments foreseen by the Plan, and create the institutional conditions necessary for their implementation. </p><p>Since 1998, when the first inventory on forestry resources was completed many changes took place in Sudan. Natural resources deterioratio n and desert encroachment has extended over new areas, drought and flood cycles are more frequent, and most important of all the secession of South Sudan removed with it large areas under forests. The knowledge on the present inventory of forests resources and coverage in Sudan is almost unknown. Therefore, plan ning of forests’ rehabilitation and development and conservation would be based on mere subjective calculations and grounds. The present advancement in geographical information systems together </p>||

with ground validation can facilitate production of reliable forestry (and range) inventory that can be used for planning and supporting livelihood of masses of rural people especially women ![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.028.png)who are dependent on trees and pastures. The proposed inventory aims at diversifying the definition a nd purposes of forestry and range development. These would now incorporate socio-economic livelihoods associated with forest uses and management. It also concentrates on the wood and non-wood products of forests in addition to the environmental benefits and tourism value. The function of forests also extends to include the carbon sink phenomena, already experienced in Sudan. 

***Food Security and Livelihood (FSL) Coordination*** 

FAO is currently Co-lead (with WFP) of UNHT’s Food Security and Livelihood Sector (cf. HNOs and SRPs), Pillar Co -lead (with DRA) of Economic Recovery Pillar III for implementation of DDS and Alternate Chair of the United Nations’ Programme Management Team for DDS. 

Protracted crisis contributed to jeopardizing Sudan’s food security situation. Factors contributing to food insecurity include civil and inter-ethnic conflicts, insecurity and inaccessibility,  recurrent  droughts,  floods,  erratic  rains,  refugees/IDPs  and  returnees,  drought  and  desert  encroachment,  det erioration  of  ecosystems  and  natural resources, loss of productive assets, pest infestation of crops, blockade of internal and cross-border livestock migratory routes, rising food prices aggravated by wider domestic and international economic situations. Given the multitude and magnitude of the problems facing FSL Sector, many act ors/partners have joined to help respond to the needs of the affected population. However, there is strong need to strengthen the existing FSL Sector coordination system to facilitate involvement of partners, generate and exchange update FSL data/information, avoid duplication and overlaps, reduce gaps, and promote common approaches to adequately cover the huge challenges faced by the Sector. 

The FSL Sector is one of the biggest in Sudan in terms of number of partners. There are over 75 partners in Khartoum wit h around 50 partners in respective states composed of relevant United Nations agencies, government line ministries, international and national NGOs, CSOs and CBOs. The performance and delivery levels of many  national  partners  and  institutions are  constrained  due  to  restricted  capacity  and  limited  acquaintance with  food  security  and  livelihoods approaches,  and international standards and  guidelines.  Facilitating their  access to  appropriate information, knowledge, skills and  financial resources is  expected to  improve their effectiveness in preparing for and responding to food security and livelihoods emergencies. Strengthening capacities of partn ers in: FSL assessments; application of tools, standards and guidelines; proposal development; project cycle management; report writing enhances overall delivery of the FSL sector results; and multisectoral awareness raising in DRR and crisis prevention. 

The situation in areas of operation is complex and volatile and therefore requires continuous observation and analys is as well as appropriate review and adaptation of sector strategies so that the right support is provided to the right population categories, taking into consideration the dis tinct needs of men, women boys and girls. In-depth food  security assessments are  important sources of  orientation to  accurately review and  re  adapt  Sector strategies. Continue support to  regular routine assessments such as pre and post-harvest assessments, Annual Crop and Food Supply Assessments and Food Security Monitoring System. As sessments enable Sector partners and other stakeholders to focus attention and resources on the most vulnerable and food -insecure persons, taking into consideration the needs of all categories of the affected population (i.e. men, women, girls and boys).

|**Intervention Area 2.  Enhancing Production, Productivity and Competitiveness of the Crops, Livestock and  Forestry  Subsectors and  Agricultural Climate Change** ||
| - | :- |
|**Adaptation** ||
|||
|**Objective** |To enhance the production, productivity and competitiveness of the agriculture sector (i.e. crops, livestock, fisheries and f orestry subsectors) and adapt production and post-harvest technologies and practices to climate change and variability through improved adaptive research systems and participatory extension services. |
|<p>**Rationale and Justification:** </p><p>The  majority  of  Sudan’s  land  is  quite  vulnerable  to  change  in  temperature  and  precipitation. The  country's  inherent  vulnerability  is  that  food  security  is  mainly determined by rainfall, particularly in the rural areas where more than two-thirds the population lives and where considerable areas of land are already degraded due to soil infertility and erosion as a consequence of deforestation, over-grazing and continuous mono-cropping and ploughing. Recent climate scenarios analysis indicates that the average temperature in Sudan is expected to rise significantly, i.e. 1.5º to 3.1º C during August and between 1.1º to 2.1º C during January by 2060. Average rainfall is expected to decrease by 6mm/month (i.e. five percent) during the rainy season. </p><p>It is anticipated that the humid agroclimate zones will shift southwards, rendering areas of northern states increasingly unsuitable for agriculture. For example: in Kordofan Region, millet production is predicted to decline between 15 and 62 percent sorghum between 29 and 71 percent and gum Arabic between 25 to 30 percent by 2060. Most affected will be the small-scale rainfed farmers, agropastoralists and pastoralists. It is expected that increases in temperature and variability in precipitation combined with growing socio-economic pressure are likely to intensify the ongoing process of desertification in the country. Under such a scenario, the area of arable land as well as the gum Arabic belt would decrease hence food security and local income will drop dramatically. </p><p>The availability of water is already perennially critical issue in an extremely arid country such as Sudan. There will be a risk of decreased precipitation and/or increased temperature and evaporation that has grave repercussions for the country. It is anticipated that, in a matter of years, water availability may be the most critical issue facing traditional rainfed areas of Sudan. The water assessment shows soil moisture declining under future climate conditions. A combination of water consumption, population growth, high rates of evaporation and high rainfall variation are predicted to lead to a situation of water crisis. </p><p>Sudan is also experiencing an increase in the frequency of devastating floods of two specific types, namely: (i) torrential r ain, when high levels of water overflow the River Nile and its tributaries, usually due to above normal rainy seasons in the Ethiopian Plateau; and (ii) heavy locali zed rainfall during the rainy summer season. In addition to drought and floods there are other climate extreme events such as dust storms, thunderstorms and heat waves whose occurrence, though less frequent, still pose s erious threat to local livelihoods. Studies have also highlighted the increased risk of malaria and water-borne diseases, transmission due to climate change. </p><p>MoAI and MoLFR acknowledge the wide gap between the scientific knowledge of central-level researchers and the techniques practiced by traditional smallholder farmers of Sudan. While there remains an unacceptably large gap between the production levels obtained by small-scale farm units compared to that of Khartoum and Wad Medani-based research institutes, there is also concern about the significant gap that exists between the productivity levels of the latter and state-level research stations  and  demonstration  farms/plots  of  government  extension  services.  In  this  context,  traditional  government -led  agricultural  extension  services  are  proving ineffective as State Ministries of Agriculture and Animal Resources lack the resources to operate a large network of state-level subject matter specialists, locality-level extension officers and village-level extension agents. More and more, resource-poor smallholder farmers are seeking (usually, with little success) alternative sources for new technologies and problem-solving solutions, e.g. local NGOs, credit officers and agents, staff and students of local universities and agricultural schools and local shopkeepers/salespersons of farm inputs. </p><p>However, such services are *ad hoc* and location and project-specific and, like government research and extension staff, these extensionists lack up-to-date knowledge on climate-smart agricultural technologies and practices and adaptive research and participatory learning approaches to technology transfer (e.g. FFSs and CARDAs) that have proved successful with groups of smallholder men and women farmers, agropastoralists and pastoralists all over the world. In Sudan, the EU-funded and FAO- implemented SPCRP-CB demonstrated the merits of and trained government extension staff and community based facilitators and associates in the “FFS approach” to </p>||

|**Intervention Area 3. Natural Resource Management and Livelihoods Response, Protection and Recovery** ||
| - | :- |
|||
|**Objective** |To secure the access and sustainable management of natural resources (i.e. land, water, forests and rangelands) by pastoral, agropastoral and forest- dependent communities prone to recurring hazards, and enhance the protection and recovery of livelihoods of vulnerable rural communities at risk to natural and man-made threats and crises. |
|<p>**Rationale and Justification:** </p><p>Sudan is affected by the fluctuation in magnitude and distribution of the precipitation during the rainy season, with repeated dry spells during the cultivation season that have negative effects on food production and people’s livelihoods.  The food security and undernourishment situation in Sudan is reported to be deteriorating in the last few years. This is  mainly attributed to the rainfall variability, high food prices, and the long decades of conflict and unrest.   Food insecurity is the mo st common manifestation of such situations. </p><p>In the 2011/2012 production season, and due to the drought cycle that hit the Horn of Africa, food production shortages were combined with insecurity in South Blue Nile, South Kordofan, some areas in Darfur, and Abyei, resulting in food insecurity and escalating food prices due to inflati on and local currency devaluation. Insecurities in productive southern areas of South Kordofan and Blue Nile State have a direct impact on the traditional seasonal north -south migration of nomadic cattle herders. Lack of access to these grazing lands is increasing the concentration of animals in Sudan. As a result, competition over meagre resources of water and grazing pasture may contribute to local disputes over natural resources. Furthermore, large herds in small areas are likely to lead to overgrazin g and increased susceptibility to communicable diseases, and will deteriorate the general livestock body condition. Similarly, each crop production zone or system has its own climate endowments and therefore, livelihoods in those areas will be affected differently. The eastern and western regions of the country recorded poor to below average harvests, which has exacerbated the  food  insecurity and  malnutrition cases among the  vulnerable groups of  the  rural  communities, particularly th e  displaced pastoral groups.  The  erratic and  low precipitation during drought years has resulted in deep water table, which in-turn made access to drinking water for human and livestock a problem. This is in addition to the crowdedness around water points, which can make people and livestock vulnerable to diseases and epidemics. This competition over meagre water resources may hatch into poor hygiene and contaminated water, particularly for vulnerable members of households, i.e., children, the elderly and women. </p><p>The outmigration of strong members of the rural communities for gold mining contributed further to the low productivity of cr ops and livestock.  The erratic rainy season has a push effect on the human resources of the rural rainfed areas to urban settings, where the urban population has increased tremendously over the last decade, while urban poverty has become a feature in main towns. This is further exacerbated by the new emerging income opportunities in the gold mining areas, which are more attractive to young members of the rural communities since it pays better than seasonal rainfed cultivation.  Food production and food secu rity in rural rainfed areas are associated with repeated risks of long dry spells, localized floods, localized pests infestation, etc., that many times, have caused damage, loss and depletion of basic assets of rural households. </p><p>The recurrent droughts in rural areas of the country have a direct impact on people’s livelihood, survival and low productivi ty for crops, livestock, trees and range. Drought has a direct effect on the productivity of rainfed crops.   It also predisposes the deterioration of livestock product ivity as a result of poor pasture, leading to movement of herds to longer distances in search of pasture and water. The indigenous and palatable pasture seeds' stock are depleted as they are grazed before the flowering stage.  The low productivity and production in rural areas resulted in a shortage of supply of food products to the markets. As a corollary, the sustainable flow of grains and livestock products diminished, which pushed investment away to sustainable irrigated sectors, real estate, serv ices and industries in urban areas.  All of these factors fed the continuation of the poverty cycle:   malnutrition and food in security increases, indigenous social safety nets are eroded, while coping strategies, along with the general resilience to shock weaken.  On the other hand, urban migrants competing with urban dwellers for incom e opportunities and basic services of health, education, and water, has resulted in more financial resources directed to urban settings. </p><p>The 2011 “Doha Document for Peace in Darfur” paved the way for the Government of Sudan and United Nations to prepare a six -year development strategy for the </p>||

The “Developing Darfur: A Reconstruction and Recovery Strategy (DDS)” aims “at realizing short-term and medium-term objectives in the fields  of  rehabilitation,  reconstruction,  construction  and  development  taking  into  consideration  urgent  needs  and  the  need  to  work  out  the  basis  for  long-term development – giving special attention to programmes and projects which will enable Darfur to speed up the transition from relief to develo pment”. In support of DDS, FAO, the Darfur Land Commission and Darfur State Ministries of Agriculture and Animal Resources prepared a “Programme for Agricultural Recovery, Reconstruction and Development in the Darfur Region (June 2013), which comprises one “capacity development subprogramme” (which has been incorporated as a cross-cutting element of CPF/PoA for Sudan) and three “model investment projects”, two of which have been incorporated in this PoA Intervention Area 3 , i.e. “recovery of food security and livelihoods of  vulnerable farming and  agropastoral communities in  rainfed  catchment areas”  and  “recovery of  food  security  and  livelihoods of  vulnerable pastoral agropastoral communities along migratory stock routes”. </p><p><i>FAO would build on lessons learned from completed and ongoing projects, namely: DCPSF-funded “increasing cooperation between conflicting communities through promoting dialogue and enhancing livelihoods and NRM in North and West Darfur States” (2009 -2014; USD two million); CIDA-funded and FAO and UNIDO-implemented “IFSP in Kassala State” (2012-2016; USD 5.92 million (FAO component)); UK/DFID-funded and FAO, UNICEF and WFP-implemented “Joint resilience-building project in Kassala” (2014-2017; USD 5.8 million (FAO component)); TCP-funded “Technical assistance to support food security and livelihoods of the pastoralist groups in West Kordofan State (one year; USD 500 000);and Government of Qatar-funded “Recovery of livelihoods of vulnerable pastoralist and agropastoralist households in the Darfur Region” (18 months; USD 2.3 million) African Development Bank-funded “Multinational Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Programme – Project II (Sudan Component) (60 months; USD 30 million); as well as short-term humanitarian food security restoration and livelihood protection projects funded by various multilateral and bi-lateral donors in conflict and drought-affected areas of Sudan.</i> </p></th></tr>

|**Intervention Area 4. National, Regional and International Control of Threats to Sudanese Food Chains** ||
| - | :- |
|||
|**Objective** |To improve Sudan’s capacity for preparedness, early warning, controlling and monitoring local, national and international thr eats to the country’s food chains, in particular transboundary animal diseases (TADs) and low-quality, contaminated and condemned foodstuffs. |
|<p>**Rationale and Justification:** </p><p>There areas two threats along Sudanese food chains where producers and consumers alike are at considerable risk to their livelihood and health, namely TADs and unsafe food. </p><p>***Transboundary Animal Diseases*** </p><p>Livestock production forms an important component of the Sudanese economy, representing 60 percent of the agricultural GDP (and 22 percent of the national GDP) with a value of USD 18.2 billion in 2009. It is estimated that there are more than 105 million heads of cattle, sheep, goats and camels in the country. Most of the animal resources are  owned  by  nomadic tribes  (“pastoralists”) and  less  by  small-scale sedentary farmers (“agropastoralists”) in  the  rainfed  traditional farming areas.  The livestock subsector provides livelihood for 14 to 20 percent of the total population and contributed 56 percent of agricultural export revenues in 2012 (compared to an average of 27 percent between 1997 and 2009). </p><p>In the past, Sudan has encountered repeated and extensive outbreaks of high impact TADs including foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), lumpy skin disease, sheep and goat pox, Rift Valley fever, pest des petite ruminants and others. Production diseases such as brucellosis and mastitis are also widespread and prevalent . These TADs present significant economic burdens to farming communities with serious livelihood implications. One of the main drivers of emergence, spread and spill-over is the movement of animals and their products – especially given the migratory nature of pastoralism in Sudan. There is therefore a high risk that such diseases may spread from any one of the country’s seven neighbouring countries. Emergency and annual vaccination campaigns are the major control measures used by the national veteri nary services to minimize the impacts of disease outbreaks – often with support of FAO. The challenges from introduction of new stains of viruses (e.g. recent SAT2 FMD outbreaks), lack of coherent disease control policy, under funding of veterinary services and lack of holistic risk -based surveillance and control strategies pose major hindrances to the effectiveness of the veterinary services and their surveillance and control systems. </p><p>The Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD) was established in 2006 as FAO’s response to combat avian and human influenza (AHI) introduct ion and spread in the world. Through the FAO/ECTAD programmes, countries such as Egypt have benefited from a substantial technical and financial assistance, whereby the institutional  capacity  of  the  veterinary  services  has  been  significantly  improved,  epidemio-surveillance  networks  and  capacity  established  in  most  the  country’s governorates, considerable laboratory diagnostics capacity created, both at national and subnational levels, and capacities for implementation biosecurity measures in poultry farms and other bird congregation points strengthened. </p><p>FAO-ECTAD Eastern Africa, also established in 2007   to address HPAI threat in East Africa (including Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti , Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and DR Congo) has over the last seven years moved beyond HPAI to address other TADs of high priority in the region. The ECTAD Eastern Africa office supports the three major animal health thematic networks for the twelve countries. At the moment, Sudan is the duty chairperson of the Chief Veterinary Officers’ Network. The purpose of the networks is to coordinate and harmonize control of TADS – as the region is faced by similar TADs. Through the “Vet Gov” programme jointly implemented by African Union Inter-African Bureau for Animal Diseases (AU-IBAR), World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and FAO, FAO-ECTAD has supported training of livestock policy-hub focal persons in each country, but more is required to support policy development and generation of evidence.  Building o n the lessons learned and good practices from AHI programmes, FAO through ECTAD offices in E gypt, Nairobi and Bamako is currently moving towards planning to mount a project on emerging pandemic threats (EPT-2) of other important TADs in identified epizones of the Near East Region. The same principle could hold true in combating high-impact TADs of economic significance and with serious livelihood implications in Sudan. ECTAD Egypt and Eastern Africa offices, will coordinate the work in Sudan </p>||

with support of the AU-IBAR and the IGAD Centre for Pastoral Areas and Livestock Development (ICPALD) which are currently implementing the USAID-funded “Standard Methods and  ![](Aspose.Words.dcbf118c-68dd-4b16-b39b-7bcc03870b00.041.png)Procedures in  Animal Health  (SMP-AH)” and  European Union-funded “Surveillance of  Trade-Sensitive Diseases (STSD)”  projects  aiming to  contribute addressing TAD’s issues within the IGAD Region. FAO will also focus more on up-scaling validated farm-level biosecurity models and community-animal health and surveillance services to improve animal health and production at the grassroots level. 

***Food Safety*** 

The Sudanese Standards and Metrology Organization (SSMO) was established in 1992 and, since then, the Organization has taken over the full responsibility of issuing all commodity standards including food. SSMO issued more than 1 000 food standards following the CODEX and ISO recommendations. SSMO also enforced the 2008 Act, which gives the organization the power to inspect all food commodities produced locally, as well as imported or exported. The bulk of work of food safety in Sudan now is carried by SSMO and the standards issued cover all types of commodities, code of practices, guidelines, sanitary requirements and measures for food establishments and transportation vehicles. 

No studies have been carried out to estimate the health impact of food-borne diseases in Sudan. Disease outbreaks have affected productivity, income generation and raised expenditure on health. Failure to meet safety requirements of importing countries threatened agricultural products. Improper control of food hygiene and safety results in the occurrence of many cases of food-borne infections and intoxications. The most common diseases are those caused by bacterial contamination such as salmonella, staphylococcus, bacillus and clostridium food poisoning, also typhoid and paratyphoid infections are common. 

Standards are  prepared  by  technical  committees according to  well-established procedures of  the  SSMO.  These  technical  committees have  members from  various stakeholders,  which  include:  industries,  business,  research  centres,  universities,  ministries,  labour  associations,  consumer  protection  associations  and  experts  to guarantee a wide range of consultation. The main challenges faced in Sudanese food safety are: (i)  human resource capacity is inadequate in terms of food safety management tools such as hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) and risk analysis amongst food inspectors and foo d safety managers in micro, small and some medium enterprises; (ii) statistics available on food-borne disease in Sudan are not well analysed and documented; (iii) the equipment available in food testing laboratories are outdated; (iv) high costs involved in compliance to market requirements; (v) lack of harmonization in food-related legislations; (vi) lack of consumer confidence; (vii) maintaining food quality (including provision of efficient laboratory services); (viii) knowledge and skills in current/and emerging food safety issues; (ix) surveillance of food-borne diseases and disease outbreaks; (x) penalties for unhygienic premises and unsafe food are low and enforcement is weak; and (xi) coordination of food safety inspection and monitoring activities is difficult. 

However, Sudan has recognized the need to have an effective and coordinated Food Safety Management System and has initiated consultation among regulatory bodies to facilitate commitment on the establishment of a coordinating body that will promote effective integrated and coordinated system. 

*FAO would build on lessons learned from completed and ongoing projects, namely: Codex Trust Fund-funded and joint FAO/WHO-implemented “Mycotoxin in Sorghum* *Project” (2013-2014); and TCP-funded “Surveillance and diagnosis of foot and mouth disease” (2011-2014; USD 491 000).*
