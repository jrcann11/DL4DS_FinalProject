<a name="_page6_x69.00_y72.00"></a>Executive Summary  

**While agriculture remains the mainstay for a large share of the population in Sudan, and rural poverty has seen a dramatic decrease (between 2009 and 2014/15), poverty remains relatively high among those  engaged  in  agriculture.**  Households  engaged  in  agriculture—either  crop  farming  or  raising livestock—see among the highest rates of poverty among households classified by their main livelihoods in Sudan. As these households form a major bulk of the total population, understanding why these households remain poor and identifying strategies for lifting them out of poverty is a key concern for researchers and policy makers. This concern occupies the primary motivation for this study. 

**Using  data  from  the  2009  National  Baseline  Household  Survey  (NBHS)  and  2014/15  National Household Budget and Poverty Survey (NHBPS), this study sheds light on the rural landscape in Sudan.** This is done using measures of rural welfare, such as poverty, asset ownership, and consumption. The focus is on the relationship between poverty and the agricultural livelihoods of rural households, and the geographic variation in these relationships. Empirically investigating the constraints to improving agrarian livelihoods, specifically by improving agricultural productivity and profitability, may guide policy toward increasing incomes and welfare in rural Sudan. By examining regional variation in agricultural practices, region-specific recommendations are made to guide potential policy interventions. 

**Though rural Sudan has fared much better than urban Sudan between survey rounds, the number of poor remains higher in rural than in urban areas.** In 2014/15, an estimated 36.1 percent of Sudan’s population had per capita expenditure below the national poverty line. When measured against the international poverty line of  US$3.20 per person per day (moderate  poverty, a standard typical for lower-middle-income countries), 46.1 percent of the population was deemed poor in 2014/15 (World Bank 2019). About two-thirds of the population of Sudan lives in rural areas while one-third lives in urban areas. The later survey shows an almost equal rate of poverty in the urban and rural areas, implying that approximately the same ratio of poor resides in urban and rural Sudan. However, rural areas tend to have a higher poverty gap, the ratio by which the mean level of measured welfare falls below the poverty line, reflecting a higher severity of poverty in rural areas. 

**Sudan severely lags other African countries in terms of agricultural productivity.** Sorghum, Sudan’s most  commonly  produced  crop—grown  by  close  to  half  the  agrarian  households—has  seen  yields increase from below 500 kg per ha in 1995 to almost 700 kg per ha in 2017. However, other African countries that are major producers of sorghum, with comparable average incomes, have significantly higher levels of productivity. Sudan’s neighbor, Ethiopia, has achieved far higher rates of productivity growth of both sorghum and millet, Sudan’s other staple crop. Sustaining gains in poverty reduction, particularly in rural Sudan, will require lifting income levels of agrarian households by increasing farm productivity and profitability. Given the low starting point for productivity in Sudan, this is an achievable policy goal. 

**A major constraint to improving crop productivity in Sudan is the low use of productivity-enhancing inputs,  particularly  fertilizers  and  pesticides  and  low-yield  seed  varieties.**  Increasing  fertilizer  and pesticide use and adopting high-yield seed varieties, often in conjunction, is perhaps the most direct way to increase household-level farm productivity, without requiring large-scale public investments in infrastructure. Differences in productivity exist between households that use such inputs and those that do not. Furthermore, the poor are far less likely to use these inputs, perpetuating a cycle of poverty. Increasing  the  rate  at  which  these  inputs  are  used,  especially  by  the  poor,  can  go  a  long  way  in increasing  productivity,  thus  reducing  rural  poverty.  Such  gains  can  be  especially  large  in  regions primarily engaged in subsistence agriculture, as the marginal returns from low usage rates can have substantial positive welfare impacts on the poorest communities in Sudan. 

**Increasing input use can be achieved by investing in rural markets.** Improving input markets so that every rural farmer has market access to purchasing such inputs is the first step in ensuring that public policies that promote such input use, such as subsidizing the price of these inputs or promoting these products through public extension services, achieve their desired effect.** It is vital that the gains from any such  programs  are  directed  toward  the  small-scale  agrarian  households  that  make  up  the  bulk  of Sudan’s rural population; the universal presence of agrarian input markets in rural Sudan is necessary for such an outcome.  

**Market participation of agrarian households in Sudan is low, constraining farmers’ ability to raise their income levels and escape poverty.** Improved access to output markets is just as important as improved access to input markets. The current state of rural infrastructure imposes significant transaction costs and risks on farmers who grow and sell their farm produce in markets. In addition to low productivity levels, many Sudanese farmers, particularly the poorest, produce crops at close to subsistence levels of production and hence, consume most of their harvest rather than use it for market exchange. Improving these households’ ability to market their produce profitably can motivate them to either grow above subsistence levels or to switch to production of commercial crops.  

**Improving rural transportation and telecommunications networks, providing access to rural credit and financial services, and increasing the ease of doing business for input providers and output marketers can increase the geographic penetration of agrarian input and output markets.** Such investments will need  to  cater  to  the  diversity  of  economic,  social,  and  cultural  norms  of  agrarian  communities throughout Sudan. A thriving nonagricultural economy that services the agricultural economy is seen as an  essential  means  of  transforming  low-productivity,  subsistence  agriculture  to  high-productivity, commercial agriculture. 

**Though sorghum and millet remain the dominant crops grown in Sudan, the recent increase in the number  of  households  growing  sesame  is  a  welcome  development.**  The  growth  of  sesame  as  a commercial crop has seemingly improved the livelihoods of many Sudanese agrarian households.** With a significant increase in the cultivation of sesame, the region of Kordofan has seen drastic reduction in poverty (except for the conflict-ridden state of South Kordofan). Further improvements in welfare can be achieved by increasing the potential of households to profit from the growth of this commercial crop, either by boosting productivity or by improving marketing channels to sell this crop.  

**Deteriorations  in  the  irrigation  infrastructure  need  to  be  reversed  to  ensure  Sudan  remains competitive  in  the  export  of  commercial  crops.**  Sudan’s  vast  irrigation  network  requires  increased investments to ensure continued productivity of the commercial crops grown on these lands, such as sugarcane, sesame, cotton, groundnut, wheat, vegetables, fruits, and green fodder. Export of these crops brings vital foreign exchange into the country. Increasing productivity by investing in agriculture and irrigation will ensure that this sector continues to not only provide for the livelihoods of agrarian households but also provides vital employment for agrarian laborers working on commercial-size farms.  **Access  to  cell  phones  has  significantly  increased  channels  of  communication  for  the  rural  poor.** Leveraging such channels to provide information on best practices,** including in agriculture, can aid these households  in  making  more  productive  decisions.  Improved  coverage  can  serve  not  only  as  a communication tool but also as a platform for service delivery in rural areas, especially for financial services. Like other countries in the region, the use of mobile-based money transfer networks can vastly increase financial transfers and transactions in rural communities, and may one day provide a means of accessing credit for credit-starved small-scale agrarian households.

1. Introduction<a name="_page9_x69.00_y72.00"></a> 

**As one of Africa’s largest countries, Sudan has immense ethnic, cultural, geographic, and ecological diversity.**  There  are  19  major  ethnic  groups  and  more  than  100  spoken  languages  and  dialects, showcasing the combination of the original inhabitants of the Nile valley and migrants from the Arab peninsula. At the intersection of the Sahel and the East Sudanian Savannas, while possessing the longest flow path of the world’s longest river, the Nile, Sudan’s agro-ecological diversity mirrors its ethnic and cultural diversity, with 19 distinct agricultural livelihood zones defined within its boundaries [(Figure a](#_page9_x69.00_y234.00)). Administratively, Sudan is divided over 18 states. This report uses six regions for classifying these 18 states, as seen in[ Figure b](#_page9_x69.00_y234.00).

**Agriculture is the backbone of the Sudanese economy, generating one-third of gross domestic product (GDP) and a labor share of more than 50 percent [(Figure 2)](#_page10_x69.00_y72.00).** In 2000, agriculture’s contribution to the GDP of Sudan was estimated at 40 percent (expressed as a percentage of value added) with a labor share  of  about  60  percent.  With  the  discovery  and  production  of  oil,  the  economic  importance  of agriculture decreased significantly. However, since the secession of South Sudan in 2011 and with it three-quarters of the oil output and two-thirds of foreign exchange earnings, agriculture has reemerged in  economic  prominence.  Agriculture’s  share  of  GDP,  which  was  estimated  at  24  percent  in  2011, increased to 33 percent in 2012. Similarly, labor’s share in agriculture, which stood at 50 percent at the time  of  South  Sudan's  secession  in  2011,  increased  to  54  percent  in  2012.  The  reemergence  of agriculture in economic importance after the secession of South Sudan necessitates an investigation of the strengths and weaknesses of the sector.

**Since the early 1990s, the relative rate of assistance (RRA)**[^3] **(a measure of pro-agricultural policies), has been increasing for Sudan (Kym and Signe 2013).** This measure has increased from being negative (indicating an anti-agricultural bias) to being slightly positive (indicating a pro-agricultural bias). Policies that restrict the export of agricultural commodities and promote the industrial sector by taxing the agricultural sector contribute to negative values for the RRA, as was observed in the early 1990s. As Sudan has reversed these policies, much like other African and developing countries, this indicator has steadily  increased.  However,  since  the  2007–08  world  food  price  crisis,  the  increasing  trend  in  this measure has reversed slightly. The increase in the RRA since the early 1990s, indicating an improving policy  environment  for the  agricultural  sector, may  be  a  reason  for the  significant  declines  in  rural poverty (as shown in Section II).

**A  sharp  increase  in  agricultural  exports  since  the  independence  of  South  Sudan  has  been  driven largely by an increase in the sale of sesame and sugar [(Figure 4a](#_page12_x69.00_y72.00)).** Though these are only a share of the value of the lost oil exports, the rapid increase in agricultural output demonstrates Sudan’s tremendous agricultural productive capacity. These developments are also indicative of agriculture’s ability to serve as a vital source of foreign exchange [(Figure 4b](#_page12_x69.00_y72.00)) and to provide raw materials to the country’s nascent food industry (World Bank 2018). More recent reports (FAO 2019) suggest that Sudan has been able to further  capture  the  international  market  for  sesame  seeds,  due  to  favorable  weather,  and  reduced exports from other major producers. 

**This increased prominence of agriculture in the Sudanese economy has been interpreted as evidence of a reverse ‘Dutch Disease’**. This term describes the apparent causal relationship between the sudden increase in the energy sector and the decline in other sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and manufacturing. Sudan has experienced a reversal of this phenomenon due to the sudden decline in oil production.  How  Sudan  copes  with  this  change  in  economic  fortunes  will  be  vital  in  ensuring  the prosperity of the Sudanese economy and its people, especially the most economically vulnerable, such as the rural poor. Agriculture has an important role to play in this economic transition. This report shows that investing in agriculturally productive Sudanese households can lead to significant improvement in their welfare and the prosperity of the nation.

**Agriculture, particularly crop farming, is an important source of livelihood for Sudanese households, particularly in rural areas [(Figure 5)](#_page13_x69.00_y72.00).** In 2014, 40 percent of rural households identified crop farming as their main livelihood. Despite the decrease from 50 percent in 2009, crop farming still represents the most common source of livelihood in rural Sudan. In urban areas, only around 5 percent of households engage in crop farming (which is likely to be peri-urban farming). Around 5 percent of rural households identified animal husbandry as their main source of livelihood. Agriculture’s importance to households in rural Sudan links the study of the rural economy with understanding the agricultural decisions and outcomes of these agrarian households.**

*Note:* \* 'Wages and salary' may include some households that are employed in agrarian work but are paid in wages. The individual survey, as opposed to the household survey, suggests that around 20 and 30 percent of such individuals in rural Sudan were in fact farming crops or raising livestock in 2009 and 2014/15, respectively. 

**Poverty  rates  among  agricultural  households  are  significantly  higher  than  the  poverty  rates  of nonagricultural  households  [(Figure  6a](#_page14_x69.00_y72.00)).**  This  disparity  is  observed  both  in  the  rural  and  urban population  and  holds  true  for  both  2009  and  2014/15.  Though  overall  rural  poverty  has  reduced significantly between 2009 and 2014/15, this disparity has stayed almost constant. Within rural Sudan, poverty is especially high for those engaged in crop farming, as opposed to those engaged in animal husbandry [(Figure 6b](#_page14_x69.00_y72.00)). The higher rates of poverty for agrarian households further motivate this study to examine agricultural production in Sudan and its impacts on household welfare.

**Reducing poverty, particularly for agricultural households, requires reforms that will boost incomes from  agricultural  activities.**  This  paper  aims  to  examine  the  relationship  between  agriculture  and household welfare. With the significant loss of government revenue following the secession of South Sudan,  agricultural  growth  has  the  potential  to  improve  the  welfare  of  Sudanese  households.  This entails not only increasing the agricultural productivity of Sudanese farmers but also improving access to markets, thereby allowing farmers to cheaply obtain productivity-enhancing inputs and get better prices for their marketable agricultural surplus.  

**Compared to other African countries that produce the same main crops as Sudan produces, Sudan has lagged in productivity growth [(Figure 7)](#_page15_x69.00_y138.00).** For instance, sorghum, Sudan’s most commonly produced crop, has seen yields increase from below 500 kg per ha in 1995 to almost 700 kg per ha in 2017. However, this is lower than yields in Nigeria (1,200 kg per ha) or Ethiopia (2,600 kg per ha), the latter of which has seen a dramatic increase in yields over the past couple of decades, up from 1,200 kg per ha in the mid-1990s. Similarly, among the major producers of millet in Africa, Sudan has the lowest yields despite  recent  improvements.  Like  sorghum,  millet  yields  have  grown  dramatically  in  neighboring Ethiopia. These comparisons suggest that, by imitating successful policies implemented in countries that have  seen  rapid  improvements  in  yield,  Sudan  too  can  increase  agricultural  productivity  for  all  its farmers, from small-scale household farming to large-scale commercial enterprises.**

**Agriculture remains the mainstay of most  of Sudan’s poor though agricultural productivity is low.** Hence,  increases  in  agricultural  productivity  are  expected  to  reduce  poverty.  Little  is  known  about household-level constraints to productivity gains. By examining the decisions agrarian households make, we hope to shed some light on why these yields are low and how to foster productivity growth for Sudan’s agrarian population. Understanding factors driving and hampering agricultural productivity is crucial for efforts to improve growth and reduce poverty. 

**This study will primarily use data from the Sudan 2009 NBHS and the 2014/15 NHBPS to provide insights into constraints to agricultural productivity to inform policy reform.** This study explores the complexity of rural livelihoods in Sudan, with a focus on agrarian livelihoods, by highlighting regional variations  in  welfare,  agricultural  practices  and  productivity.  This  study  also  empirically  investigates variation in household-level crop yields and relates this measure of agrarian productivity to household welfare as well as to key inputs and production variables. Factors contributing to variations in yield are identified  by  using  household-level  regressions.  Focusing  policy  on  easing  these  constraints  to productivity (such as fertilizer/pesticide use, irrigation, crop choice, land title, and so on) can lead to improvements in productivity for the average agrarian rural households and welfare for all of Sudan. 

**Though the focus of this report is on rural and agrarian households, it is important to note that urban and  rural  welfare  are  closely  related  in  developing  nations  such  as  Sudan.**  For  example,  rural livelihoods can improve by increasing agricultural productivity. Increased agricultural productivity has a direct positive effect on food producers—they can increase their own household consumption of the food they grow or they can sell some of their surplus in the market. In turn, the increased supply of food in the market could lead to a reduction in the price of food. This would increase the purchasing power and thereby the welfare of net food consumers, such as the urban poor. Just as increased productivity in the industrial sector can draw people away from rural areas, increased productivity in the rural economy can  drive  people  away  from  the  urban  sector  or  perhaps  slow  the  migration  out  of  rural  areas. Increasing agricultural productivity can therefore “serve as a social buffer for the urban poor in periods of  economic  crisis  or  social  urban  unrest”  (Anríquez  and  Stamoulis  2007).  As  Sudan  has  recently experienced both an economic crisis due to a drastic fall in oil revenues and urban unrest that has led to regime change, the importance of the rural economy cannot yet be discounted. 

**The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.**  Section  II  describes  the  state  of  the  rural population in Sudan, by first discussing the spatial distribution of poverty across the states as well as changes  in  poverty  levels  between  2009  and  2014/15.  It  also  describes  the  profile  of  poor  rural households using characteristics such as their incomes, consumption, and assets.  

Section  III  focuses  on  the  practice  of  agriculture  in  Sudan.  It  documents  the  agriculture-specific characteristics of households, such as choice of crops, use of inputs, irrigation, plot size, and credit access.  We  use  these  characteristics  to  illustrate  the  profile  of  rural  farmers  in  Sudan  and  identify differences between poor and non-poor farmers.  

Section IV describes agricultural yields across Sudan and relates these measures of farm productivity to the previously described farm characteristics to identify constraints to agricultural productivity.  

Section V concludes with a summary of the main findings and policy recommendations.

**The majority of Sudan’s population is rural.** There has been little change in the rural/urban composition of Sudan since 2009 [(Figure 8a](#_page17_x69.00_y259.00)).** Unlike most other developing countries in the development stage of their economic transition, the share of the rural population has increased, though only slightly, from 64 percent to 65 percent. While the poverty rates in urban areas have increased, the poverty rate in rural Sudan has decreased dramatically from 58 percent to 35 percent, and is now comparable to poverty rates in urban areas [(Figure 8b](#_page17_x69.00_y259.00)). As the majority of Sudan’s population is still rural, almost twice as many poor people reside in rural areas compared to urban areas [(Figure 8c](#_page17_x69.00_y259.00)). By focusing on the welfare of these households, Sudan can achieve further substantial reductions in national poverty.

**The increase in urban poverty and decrease in rural poverty might be explained by the relatively high prices of staples [(Figure 9a](#_page18_x69.00_y72.00)).** At the time NHBPS 2014/15 was conducted, both sorghum and millet prices  had  risen  significantly,  though  they  have  since  reduced.  As  the  urban  population  is  a  net consumer of food and the rural population is a net producer of food, this increase in food prices may have had an adverse effect on urban households while having a beneficial effect on rural households. These price increases might have exacerbated the already prevailing negative effect on urban areas from the reduction in oil revenues. As noted in the introduction, increasing agricultural production can bring down food prices, thereby benefitting urban consumers. Food prices have been a contributing factor  to  the  recent  political  instability,  as  prices  have  increased  rapidly  since  2018  [(Figure  9b](#_page18_x69.00_y72.00)). Increasing  Sudan’s  food  production  is  therefore as vital  for meeting  Sudan’s domestic  consumption needs as it is as a source of foreign revenue.

**Rural poverty has reduced across regions of Sudan, although states experiencing civil conflict have not seen reductions [(Figure 10)](#_page19_x69.00_y72.00).** South Kordofan, West, and Central Darfur are the only states where rural poverty has not reduced. These states witnessed conflict due to separatist movements, which have led to greater disparities in poverty rates between these regions and the rest of Sudan. In 2014/15, these states had the highest rates of rural poverty. More recently, due to armed conflicts subsiding in Darfur, there has been a steady trend of internally displaced persons (IDPs) returning over the past few years (FAO  2019).  As  these  households  return  to  engaging  in  agriculture,  the  Darfur  region’s  agricultural production has also seen significant gains.

  **The average rural household earns at least one-third of its total income from agriculture, while this is only  5  percent  in  urban  Sudan  [(Figure  11)](#_page20_x69.00_y72.00).**  This  is  not  surprising  given  that  the  majority  of  rural households  depend  on  agriculture  as  a  source  of  livelihood  with  little  diversification  into  the nonagricultural sector. The dependence on agriculture is predominant among the rural poor, with at least 39 percent of the total income of the rural poor accruing from agriculture compared to 31 percent for the rural non-poor. Importantly, the actual reliance on agriculture is likely to be higher than these numbers suggest, as income from wages is often tied to agricultural employment. The surveys do not make it possible to accurately differentiate the source of wage employment.

**Across states, there is significant variation in the dependence on agriculture [(Figure 12a](#_page21_x69.00_y138.00)).** In the Darfur and Kordofan regions, agriculture is the main source of income for most households. In Khartoum, the Red Sea, and Al-Gadarif, nonagricultural activities and income from wages and salaries are the main sources of household income. In states such as Al-Gezira, Sinnar, Kassala, and the River Nile, wages and salaries  are  important  sources  of  income  for  households,  but  due  to  the  importance  of  irrigated agriculture in these states, such wages and salaries are mostly tied to agricultural employment.  

**Households in states in the irrigation belt rely heavily on wages and salaries as their main source of income [(Figure 12a](#_page21_x69.00_y138.00)).** These are in the Blue and White Nile regions of Sudan, including the states of Al- Gezira, the White Nile, Sinnar, and the Blue Nile, and in the rural areas of the states of Khartoum and the River Nile. Households that earn incomes from wages and salaries are often employed in agrarian work in the rural regions of these agrarian states with their easy access to irrigation. Such agrarian work is often done on large commercial farms, including those in the large agricultural schemes. The major irrigation schemes include Al-Gezira in Al-Gezira state, the New Haifa Scheme in Kassala, and the Rahad Scheme in the Blue Nile. Pump irrigation schemes also exist in the Northern, River Nile, Blue Nile, and White Nile and in the Suki Scheme in Sinnar state (FAO 2015). 

**Households in Darfur and Kordofan rely more on direct incomes from agriculture, through sales of crop and livestock produce, as opposed to incomes from wages and salaries [(Figure 12a](#_page21_x69.00_y138.00)).** Agricultural production in these states is much less reliant on large irrigated farms and hired labor than in the irrigation belt. The disparity in poverty rates between households whose main livelihood is agriculture and those whose main livelihood is from wages and salaries therefore stems primarily from geographic differences. As shown in Section III.A, agrarian households in these regions cultivate millet primarily for subsistence needs, with increasing cultivation of sesame for sale in Kordofan. 

**Wages  and  salaries  have  increased  as  an  important  share  of  total  income,  at  the  expense  of agricultural and nonagricultural incomes [(Figure 12b](#_page21_x69.00_y138.00)).** A vast majority of households in Al-Gezira, a state known for its large-scale irrigation scheme, earn wages and salaries primarily from agrarian work. Most states have seen some increase in the proportion of total income earned from wages and salaries. This suggests the increasing importance of large and commercial farms in these regions of Sudan. As seen earlier [(Figure 6b](#_page14_x69.00_y72.00)), due to the lower rates of poverty for households earning incomes from wages and salaries, their increasing share in the population has contributed to a reduction in rural poverty.

**The contribution of nonagricultural income to total household income has not increased, either for the poor or the  non-poor [(Figure 13)](#_page22_x69.00_y138.00).** In fact, on average, households  were slightly less reliant on nonagricultural  incomes  in  2014  than  in  2009.  Rural  Sudan  has  therefore  become  more  reliant  on agricultural  wage  incomes  (possibly  a  form  of  tenant  farming)  and  less  reliant  on  nonagricultural incomes. Given that households with nonagricultural incomes have lower poverty rates [(Figure 6b](#_page14_x69.00_y72.00)), the stagnation in rural income diversification is probably holding back further welfare improvements in rural Sudan. Poor households earn a significantly smaller proportion of their income from nonagricultural sources.

**Incomes are fairly specialized in rural Sudan, for both the poor and the non-poor [(Figure 14)](#_page23_x69.00_y72.00).** Almost one-fourth of non-poor households identify earning all their income from agricultural sources, while almost one-third of poor households identify earning all their income from agricultural sources. Around 40 percent of non-poor households earn all their income only from nonagricultural sources, while about 25 percent of poor households can claim the same. The non-poor are therefore observed to be less reliant on agriculture than the poor. It is hard to establish whether poverty leads to a greater reliance on incomes  earned  solely  from  agriculture  or  whether  finding  a  way  to  diversify  incomes  away  from agriculture leads to reduced poverty. If it is the latter, then policies that wean households away from complete reliance of agricultural incomes may reduce poverty.

**The gap between incomes and wages in rural and urban Sudan has significantly reduced since 2009 [(Figure 15)](#_page24_x69.00_y72.00).** The ratio of total rural income to total urban income has increased throughout the country, and the ratio for wages and salaries has increased in most states. This again shows that rural Sudan has fared better than urban Sudan. As there has been no increase in nonagricultural incomes, most of this increase has come from increased agricultural incomes, either through own crop production and sales, or through agrarian employment, as reflected in the increased share of income from wages and salaries.

**Both food and non-food consumption are significantly lower for the poor compared to the non-poor, in both rural and urban areas [(Figure 16)](#_page25_x69.00_y72.00).** Lower rates of food consumption by the poor in rural Sudan are  of  special  concern,  because  lower  food  consumption  can  trap  households  in  cycles  of  poverty. Insufficient energy needs can result in greater difficulties maintaining employment, especially in labor- intensive agricultural work. Lower energy and nutrient intake can lead to greater incidence of disease and poor growth in children. Addressing this inequality, so that all Sudanese citizens have a healthy and sustainable diet of food, is vital for creating a prosperous Sudanese economy.

**Both food and non-food expenditures remain lower in rural Sudan compared to urban Sudan [(Figure** ](#_page25_x69.00_y458.00)**

[**17)](#_page25_x69.00_y458.00)**.** These differences are significantly higher for non-food expenditure, whereas only small differences exist for food expenditure. However, as there are differences in prices between the rural and urban areas, food consumption is likely higher in rural areas, something which is to be expected, due to the increased physical demands of agrarian work. Differences in non-food consumption, where the urban population on average consumes almost twice the monetary amount as the rural sector, are unlikely to be due to different prices. As we note in the next subsection, such non-food expenditure may account for differences in asset ownership between urban and rural Sudan. Some assets, such as those that aid in communication and transport, can improve the productive capacity of farmers. Therefore, improving market infrastructure, to increase the opportunity for both food and non-food consumption in rural Sudan, is vital for improving rural livelihoods and alleviating poverty.

<a name="_page26_x69.00_y297.00"></a>Assets 

**Asset ownership is generally lower for the poor than the non-poor, and lower for rural households than urban households [(Figure 18**Figure 18**)](#_page27_x69.00_y72.00).** Assets that improve connectivity and increase access to information, such as televisions, satellite dishes, radios, mobile phones, phones, and computers, are more  common  in  urban  areas  than  in  rural  areas,  while  the  poor  have  very  little  access  to  these resources. This means that sharing agricultural information with farmers, especially poorer farmers, can be  a  challenge.  However,  cell  phones  are  now  common  in  rural  areas,  with  70  percent  of  rural households owning one. Cell phone coverage is only 60 percent for the rural poor.  

**Motorized  transport  assets,  such  as  motor  vehicles,  rickshaws,  and  motorcycles,  remain  low throughout Sudan but are more common in urban areas and are almost nonexistent among the rural poor.** Rural areas have significantly higher rates of asset ownership of animals used for transportation; this is especially true for the rural poor. Limited ownership of transportation assets and an inadequate transportation network can impede access to productive inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, and reduce the opportunity to market surplus agricultural produce.

3. Agriculture<a name="_page28_x69.00_y72.00"></a> in Sudan 

**Sudan has a diversified crop portfolio, grown in diverse agro-climatic conditions.** This includes cereals (such as sorghum, millet, wheat, rice and maize), oilseeds (mainly sesame, groundnut and sunflower), industrial crops (cotton and sugarcane), fodder crops (alfalfa, fodder sorghum and Rhodes grass), pulses (broad beans and pigeon peas), and horticulture crops (okra, onions, tomatoes, citrus, mango, and so on). Rural households are also extensively engaged in animal husbandry, with an estimated livestock population of 109 million heads of cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and others across the country in 2018 (FAO 2019).  

**Crop production in Sudan is practiced under three main patterns, which influence the type of crop grown (FAO 2019).**  

1) Irrigated agriculture includes large-scale irrigation schemes using  the Nile and its tributaries (such  as  the world’s  largest, the  Al  Gezira  Scheme),  large-scale  irrigation  schemes  using seasonal  floods,  and  small-scale  irrigation  practiced  by  individual  households  along  the banks  of  the  Nile  and  its  tributaries.  The  principal  crops  of  the  irrigated  sector  include sugarcane, cotton, sorghum, groundnut, wheat, vegetables, fruits, and green fodder.  
1) Semi-mechanized rain-fed agriculture is practiced across approximately 6.7 million ha and receives 500 mm average rainfall annually. It is practiced in the states of Kassala, Gadarif, Blue Nile, Sinnar, White Nile and South Kordofan. In this region, Sudan's staple sorghum accounts  for  80  percent  of  the  cultivated  land  and  produces  around  45  percent  of  the country’s requirement. Other crops include sesame, sunflower, millet, and cotton.  
1) The traditional rain-fed agriculture covers 9 million ha. This is the combined acreage of irrigated and semi-mechanized rain-fed agriculture. Due to the small scale of household- managed traditional rain-fed agriculture, it employs the greatest share of the population. Though such farming is found throughout the country, it is predominant in the west of the country, in the regions of Darfur and much of Kordofan. Subsistence crops such as sorghum and  millet  are  the  norm,  but  commercial  crops,  such  as  groundnut,  and  increasingly, sesame, are also grown on a small scale. 
- Crops<a name="_page28_x69.00_y522.00"></a> and Livestock <a name="_page28_x69.00_y551.00"></a>Crops Grown 

  **Sorghum is the most common crop grown by crop-producing households in Sudan, followed by millet [(Figure  19**](#_page29_x69.00_y109.00)**Error!  Reference  source  not  found.**).**  According  to  the  2014/15  survey,  close  to  half  the households engaged in crop farming grow sorghum. This has changed little since 2009, when slightly more than half of all households grew sorghum (note the list of crops in 2009 is different from those in 2014/15).  Approximately  one-third  of  crop-producing  households  grow  millet.  This  proportion  has increased  slightly  since  2009.  Other  common  crops  grown  are  sesame,  groundnut,  and  tea  (mainly hibiscus in Kordofan). These statistics represent households that identify a crop cultivated for their own consumption. Households that work the land with laborers and identify their income as ‘wages and salaries’ do not report which crop they grow. These statistics do not represent the proportion of crops grown at the national level; being a household-level survey, large-scale farming operations which grow commercial crops are not included.

**There are key differences between crops grown by poor and non-poor households, with subsistence crops more likely to be grown by the poor [(Figure 20)](#_page30_x69.00_y72.00).** While sorghum is grown almost equally by poor and non-poor households, millet is grown more predominantly by the poor; sesame and groundnut are grown more predominantly by the non-poor. Apart from roselle, non-poor households predominantly grow almost all the cash crops listed in the survey. This is driven by the extent to which production constraints, such as access to land, input and output markets, and credit and insurance markets, are binding for poor and non-poor households. As a result, poor households resort to low-risk, low-return subsistence  crops  such  as  millet.  Increasing  the  diversity  of  crops  grown  by  the  poor,  by  creating opportunities  to  market  profitable  crops  is  vital  to  increase  the  farm  revenues  of  poor  agrarian households.

**Most of the households engaged in crop production grow only the subsistence crops of sorghum and millet [(Figure 21a](#_page31_x69.00_y167.00)).** More than half the households, 56 percent, that engage in crop production grow only  these  two  crops  and  nothing  else.  Most  of  these  households  grow  either  millet  or  sorghum exclusively,  32  percent of  households  grow only sorghum,  22  percent  grow only millet,  and only 2 percent grow both. This means there is very little geographic overlap between these two crops. 

**Households  growing  only  sorghum  or  only  millet  have  higher  rates  of  poverty  than  households growing other crops [(Figure 21b](#_page31_x69.00_y167.00)).** Those engaged in millet production have especially high rates of poverty. These households are concentrated in Darfur and Kordofan. Households engaged in growing the other two common crops—sesame and groundnut—have significantly lower rates of poverty, while households engaged in all other types of crop production have the lowest rates of poverty. These other crops  are  primarily  cash  crops.  This  strong  positive  correlation  between  poverty  and  growing subsistence  crops  suggests  that  growing  subsistence  crops  traps  households  in  a  cycle  of  poverty. Poverty  imposes  constraints  that  prevent  households  from  diversifying  into  income-generating  cash crops. Additionally, growing low-income-generating subsistence crops prevents households from making the investments required to grow cash crops. These constraints might be regional, as some regions in Sudan  have  greater  access  to  the  infrastructure,  such  as  irrigation,  that  sustains  commercial  crop cultivation.

**Households that sell a higher proportion of their produce in the market have lower rates of poverty [(Figure 22)](#_page32_x69.00_y72.00).** Crops such as millet, sorghum, and lentils are grown predominantly to be consumed within the household. Average rates of poverty in households that produce these crops are higher than the average rates of poverty in households that produce crops that are predominantly sold in the market, such as wheat, dates, and Egyptian beans. This again suggests the nexus between subsistence crop production, lower household incomes, and poverty. However, a causal relationship is hard to establish as regions with better market infrastructure are likely to be better-off in general. Such regions will tend to sell more of their crop in the market and have a reduced likelihood of poverty, irrespective of market engagement by agrarian households.

**There are important regional differences in which crops are grown [(Figure 23)](#_page33_x69.00_y72.00).** Dates are the most common crop grown in the Nile region [(Figure 23a](#_page33_x69.00_y72.00)). Sorghum is the most common crop grown in the Eastern region, Khartoum, and the White and Blue Nile region [(Figure 23b](#_page33_x69.00_y72.00)–d). It is also the second most important crop grown in Darfur and Kordofan [(Figure 23e](#_page33_x69.00_y72.00)–f). Millet is most common in Darfur and is important in Kordofan but is not grown extensively elsewhere. The most important crop in Kordofan is sesame. 

**Sesame is a common cash crop in the Kordofan region, where it was grown by almost half of all farmers in 2014/15 [(Figure 23e](#_page33_x69.00_y72.00)).** As the 2009 survey did not include sesame as a potential crop grown, it is difficult to confirm whether the current production of sesame is a recent trend or if it has been a common crop produced by Sudanese farmers. However, as shown in[ Figure 4b](#_page12_x69.00_y72.00), the Food and Agriculture Organization of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  statistics  show  that sesame  production  and exports  have grown  significantly  during  this  time.  Substantial  reduction  in  rural  poverty  [(Figure  10b](#_page19_x69.00_y72.00))  in  two  of Kordofan’s three states (the states not affected by conflict) may be partly explained by farmers growing this cash crop.  

**Households engaged in crop production in Sudan’s most populous rural region, that is the Blue and White Nile (the states of Al-Gezira, White Nile, Sinnar, and Blue Nile), mostly grow sorghum [(Figure 23d](#_page33_x69.00_y72.00)), but larger commercial farms in this region grow cash crops.** This region is heavily irrigated. States such as Al-Gezira are known as the breadbasket of Sudan. Most households list income from wages and salaries as their main source of livelihood in these states. Information on what crops these farmers are growing is not provided in the survey. As seen in[ Figure 4b](#_page12_x69.00_y72.00), Sudan has recently increased exports of sesame and sugar. This is largely due to increased production in this region. Given that individuals from these households are employed in larger, commercial farms, increasing the productivity and profitability of these farms will be vital to ensure the prosperity of the households of such employed farmers.

**Ownership of livestock is widespread in rural Sudan, especially in the Darfur region [(Figure 24)](#_page34_x69.00_y181.00).** Cattle ownership is especially common in Al-Gezira, followed by South, Central, and East Darfur. Goat and sheep ownership is also concentrated in the Darfur region. Almost one-third of rural households own a camel; households in the Darfur region are more likely to own camels. Over half of all rural households own poultry, while almost all households in Darfur own poultry.

**For  households  that  own  livestock,  the  death  or  theft  of  their  livestock is a  common  occurrence [(Figure 25)](#_page35_x69.00_y379.00).** The questionnaires ask whether a household has been severely affected by such an event; around  one-fourth  of  households  that  own  livestock  claim  that  such  an  event  has  affected  them adversely. Higher rates are noted in Darfur, where reliance on livestock is greater than in the rest of Sudan. Such losses can cause hardships to households that rely on livestock for income, either through the sale of these assets, or through the sale of animal products. Programs that insure against the loss of livestock can help these households overcome such hardships without falling into poverty.

  **Very few households spend on agricultural inputs to increase the productivity of cultivation [(Figure 26a](#_page36_x69.00_y239.00)).** For the four major crops, only between 20 percent (for sesame) and 36 percent (for sorghum) of households spend any money on pesticides or fertilizers. An even lower proportion spends a significant amount on these inputs. The most common input expense for farmers is farm repairs (except for millet, for  which  it  is machine/equipment  repairs). Labor costs constitute the  second  most  common  input expense. Input use by the poor is generally markedly lower than that of the non-poor [(Figure 26b](#_page36_x69.00_y239.00)). A notable exception is fertilizer/pesticide use for sesame, which is used at a higher rate by the poor.

**Fertilizer/pesticide use is significantly lower for the poor compared to the non-poor [(Figure 27)](#_page37_x69.00_y109.00).** This is seen in all regions of Sudan, except for Kordofan. For Sudan as a whole, the poor are one-third less likely to  use  fertilizer/pesticides  compared  to  the  non-poor.  By  crops,  the  poor  are  far  less  likely  to  use fertilizer/pesticide for sorghum cultivation, which is the most commonly cultivated crop in Sudan.

**Greater input use is associated with greater sales of a crop by agrarian households [(Figure 28)](#_page38_x69.00_y72.00).** Crops that are sold more on average have been treated more with fertilizers and pesticides. This suggests that the incentives to increase productivity are tied to a household’s ability to sell its crop in the market. Another explanation for this relationship is that regions with adequate output markets, which allow farmers  to  profit  from  growing  cash  crops,  also  have  better  input  markets  giving  them  access  to productivity-enhancing  inputs,  such  as  fertilizers  and  pesticides.  Therefore,  improving  market infrastructure can lead to changes in the type of crop grown, from subsistence to cash crop cultivation, thereby increasing an agrarian household’s income and welfare.

<a name="_page38_x69.00_y310.00"></a>Irrigation  

**Less than one-fifth of households engaged in irrigated agriculture in Sudan [(Figure 29a](#_page39_x69.00_y72.00)).** States on the River Nile and its tributaries, the Blue and White Nile, have higher rates of irrigation. For example, the River Nile and Al-Gezira states have cultivated lands that are nearly 100 percent irrigated. States in regions  where  the  poverty  is  highest,  such  as  Kordofan  and  Darfur,  have  nearly  no  irrigation  of cultivated  lands.  Irrigation  use  has  decreased  between  2009  and  2014/15,  from  23  percent  to  18 percent, with the largest reduction seen in the Darfur region, where irrigation was already at very low levels.   

**Within states where there are significant levels of irrigation, such as in the Eastern region, Blue and White Nile regions, and Khartoum state, poor agrarian households are generally less likely to have access to irrigation for farming [(Figure 29a](#_page39_x69.00_y72.00)).** In these regions, expanding irrigation to the poor may be more economical than doing so in regions with very little irrigation infrastructure, such as the regions of Kordofan and Darfur. In these regions, there is little difference between irrigation access between the poor and the non-poor, because none of the lands are irrigated. Expanding irrigation may be costly, because there are few riverways in these areas, though pumping water from underground aquifers may be feasible.

**Very little of the land cultivated for the four main crops—sorghum, millet, groundnut, and sesame—is irrigated [(Figure 30)](#_page40_x69.00_y72.00).** Of these four crops, sorghum has the highest rate of irrigation, at 21 percent, while millet has the lowest rate of irrigation, at only 5 percent. The low rate of irrigation for millet corresponds to where it is predominantly grown, in the regions of Kordofan and Darfur. Besides these four crops, cash crops are much more likely to be grown on irrigated lands. For example, wheat and cotton are grown on irrigated lands over 80 percent of the time, while dates are almost exclusively grown on irrigated land.

**States with a high rate of fertilizer use also have high rates of irrigation [(Figure 31)](#_page40_x69.00_y364.00).** Al-Gezira, the River Nile, and the Northern states all have close to universal rates of irrigation and have very high rates of fertilizer/pesticide use. States such as the Red Sea, North Kordofan, and Central Darfur are at the other end of the spectrum, with low rates of fertilizer/pesticide use and low rates of irrigation. However, there is greater variability with fertilizer/pesticide input use, as many states have low rates of irrigation, with input use ranging from 3 percent for the Red Sea to up to 41 percent for the Blue Nile state.

<a name="_page40_x69.00_y646.00"></a>Credit 

**Over half the agrarian households access some form of credit, but most of this is from family and individual sources [(Figure 32a](#_page42_x69.00_y72.00)).** Very little credit comes from institutional sources, such as formal banks, the government, or microfinance institutions. As only 5 percent of agrarian households own a bank account, this suggests there is large potential for improving access to credit for agrarian households. Though the most common reason households cite for not obtaining a loan is the lack of need for credit, over half the households that do not obtain a loan cite some sort of hindrance to obtaining a loan [(Figure 32b](#_page42_x69.00_y72.00)).  

**The vast majority of agrarian households acquire loans for consumption needs [(Figure 32c](#_page42_x69.00_y72.00)).** However, close to one-fifth of agrarian households acquired loans for agricultural needs, the most common being farm  inputs.  Evidence  from  developing  countries  suggests  that  increased  access  to  credit  from institutional sources increases use of productivity-improving inputs, such as fertilizers and better-quality seeds, and thus improves crop productivity. Therefore, increasing access to credit can help improve farm productivity in rural Sudan.

**Comparing poverty classifications with yields of sorghum and millet reveals a negative relationship for sorghum and a positive relationship for millet [(Figure 34)](#_page44_x69.00_y268.00).** The NHBPS 2014/15 classifies households into four income classifications. Households are first classified into the poor and non-poor. Within the poor, households may be extremely poor; within the extremely poor, households may additionally be food insecure. Therefore, the four income classifications—the food insecure, the extremely poor, the poor, and the non-poor—represent households from increasing to decreasing levels of poverty. Each classification represents individuals who meet that classification but not a lower poverty classification, that is, the poor represent households that are neither extremely poor nor food insecure. The non-poor have the highest yields of sorghum; the food insecure have the lowest yields. The non-poor have the lowest yields of millet; the food insecure have the highest yields. Poverty rates by yield quantiles show a similar relationship for sorghum and millet [(Figure 35)](#_page44_x69.00_y477.00).

**States with higher yields of sorghum tend to have lower poverty rates, but this relationship again reverses for millet [(Figure 36)](#_page45_x69.00_y182.00).** The positive trend for sorghum and the negative trend for millet are explained by the more universal cultivation of sorghum, as opposed to millet, which is grown primarily in Kordofan and Darfur. As seen previously, though both crops are primarily grown for subsistence, on average only one-fifth of a household’s millet production is sold, compared to, on average, one-third of production for households growing sorghum. Millet ranks as the most subsistent of all crops grown. The greater subsistence requirement of millet means that households that rely on it for their own caloric needs may take greater efforts to ensure that it is cultivated efficiently, and sufficient is produced. Due to the relative poverty of subsistence households, this may be one reason why we observe a positive relationship between millet yield and poverty.

**Of the four main crops grown in Sudan, yields of sorghum, groundnut, and sesame are higher when grown on irrigated lands [(Figure 37)](#_page46_x69.00_y153.00).** For millet, only a statistically insignificant increase is observed, though this may be due to the very uncommon occurrence of millet being grown on irrigated lands. For the other three crops, the gains in productivity are significant and all lead to approximately 50 percent increase in yields. Better irrigation can also help agrarian households in times of drought and flooding, which affected 8 percent and 15 percent,[^6] respectively, of agrarian households in 2014/15. Irrigation can help mitigate damages to crop production during these times of adverse shocks and thus improve the households’ short- and long-run welfare.

**As Sudan has allowed for large-scale foreign ownership of fertile lands near the Nile, efficient and equitable distribution of Sudan’s water resources will need to be a policy priority.** As seen in[ Figure 38,](#_page47_x69.00_y72.00) the  previous  Sudanese  government  leased  out  lands  to  foreign**  entities  for  agricultural  operations. Irrigation  on  these  foreign  owned  operations  near  Sudan’s  major  waterways  need  to  be  carefully regulated so that communities that rely on those waters for their own livelihoods are not adversely affected by the operations of these foreign agricultural enterprises. Some operations have already had detrimental  effects  on  local  communities  (Schwartzstein  2019).  As  these  operations  also  have  the potential to employ large numbers of Sudanese agrarian workers and provide foreign investment into the country, ensuring a balanced approach in regulating the operations of these entities is vital for ensuring prosperity of the communities in and around these operations.

**Pesticide and fertilizer use tend to increase crop yields [(Figure 39a](#_page48_x69.00_y72.00)–d).** This holds true for sorghum, millet, and groundnut but not for sesame. Machine use is associated with higher yields of millet and sesame. Fuel use is associated with higher yields of sorghum and sesame. Increased labor costs are associated with greater yields of millet and groundnut, and marginally of sorghum.

**The proportion of sorghum yields to the crop sold in market exhibits a positive relationship, while millet  yields  do  not  show  any  such  relationship  [(Figure  40)](#_page49_x69.00_y72.00).**  This  helps  explain  why  a  negative relationship  between  yields  and  poverty  exists  for  sorghum  but  not  for  millet.  Increasing  yields  of sorghum are associated with improved welfare conditions, and this is in turn correlates with the ability to sell more produce in the market. For millet, due to its subsistent nature of cultivation for households in rural Sudan, increasing yields are not associated with increased opportunities to sell surplus produce. Rather, these households produce efficiently but do not sell much produce in the market, precisely because of its need for household consumption.

**As has been observed in previous studies from around the world, yield and plot area have a strong negative relationship [(Figure 41a](#_page50_x69.00_y72.00)–c).** This phenomenon, known as the inverse farm-size productivity relationship, can be attributed to a variety of factors, though no definite explanation exists. Reasons cited for this relationship include market failures (Feder 1985; Sen 1966), omitted variables related to the quality of the land (Benjamin 1995; Bhalla and Roy 1988), and measurement error relating to the size of plots (Lamb 2003). Key omitted variables include farmer effort and farm management. Larger farms employ outside labor who may shirk work or not be as motivated as household-supplied labor, which is the norm in household farms with smaller plot sizes.  

**This negative relationship was observed for Sudan and its separate regions, for all four major crops [(Figure  41a](#_page50_x69.00_y72.00)–c).**  These  findings  might  suggest  the  need  for  land  reform,  to  create  smaller  average landholding size to spur productivity growth, though the benefits of such a policy need to be carefully weighed against its possibly harmful repercussions. However, these results, and those in the following regression analysis, imply that larger plots are not necessarily helpful for increasing yields.

To gain a better understanding of determinants of productivity, it is useful to empirically analyze the significant factors causing variation in yields across households. This can be done by regressing yields on potential  determinants  while  controlling  for  certain  household  characteristics.  An  advantage  of  this approach, as opposed to looking at potential determinants individually, as done in Section IV.C, is that such analysis can account for the different determinants simultaneously and identify which among them is most accurate in explaining variations in productivity. Due to limitations of the data, this is not a causal analysis. Due to the likelihood for correlation between the determinant factors and the potential for omitted variables, it is impossible to use this analysis to conclude which factors, if changed at the household level, would lead to changes in productivity. However, it gives us a good starting point for hypothesizing over the potential causal mechanisms by which to increase productivity for the agrarian Sudanese households.  

The regression we run is as follows: 

= + 1 + 2 + , 

where  is the variable of interest, which is  logged crop yield ( = log ( )), for household  , which we analyze for the four main crops (sorghum, millet, sesame, and groundnut) separately;  are the state-level fixed effects, to account for regional heterogeneity;  are household characteristics, such  as  household  size  and  education  level  of  the  household  head;  and  are  all  the  potential determinants of crop productivity, such as input use and land ownership status. The results of this regression are presented in the following paragraphs. 

**Regressing yields on their potential determinants shows that yields  for some crops  are positively related to fertilizer/pesticide input use and the use of irrigation (Table 1).**  Though we do not see a universal impact of fertilizer/pesticide use on yields for all four crops, we do observe positive impacts for sorghum and millet. For irrigation, we observe a positive impact overall for millet and sesame but not for sorghum or groundnut. State-level controls absorb household-level variation in irrigation use. 

**Using labor and acquiring a nonagricultural loan are negatively related to sorghum yields (Table 1)**. This  could  be  because  households  that  require  labor  may  not  be  able  to  adequately  manage employment  on  their  farms,  compared  to  using  household  employment.  Households  that  acquire nonagricultural loans might have faced an economic shock that adversely affected farm productivity, resulting in a negative relationship between these types of loans and yields. No such relationship is observed for loans acquired for agricultural purposes. Rented and communal lands also observe lower yields when compared to owned lands.  

**A negative relationship between plot size and  yields is also observed for all crops, indicating the inverse  productivity  to  farm  size  relationship.**  This  supports  our  findings  that  show  the  negative relationship in [Figure 41.](#_page50_x69.00_y72.00) Rented and communally owned lands show lower yields of sorghum than owned  lands,  indicating  that  perhaps  cultivators  are  unwilling  to  make  productive,  long-term investments in such lands. 

[Table 1 ](#_page52_x69.00_y72.00)presents regression results of the determinants of yield for Sudanese farmers. The regression includes the four major crops identified in the data—sorghum, millet, groundnut, and sesame—in four separate regressions. All input use variables specify whether the household used inputs greater than 100 Sudanese pounds. Regressions use household weights and standard errors are robust.

|<p>As a log linear regression, coefficients need to be transformed. Each unit increase of the independent variable increases yield by 100 × (1 − )%, where  is the coefficient from the regression. For example, a coefficient on poor for sorghum of −0.118 means that the poor (assigned a value of  = 1) have 100 × (1 − −0.118)% = −11.3% difference in yields when compared to the non-poor (assigned a value of  = 0).

5. Conclusion<a name="_page53_x69.00_y72.00"></a> and Policy Recommendations 

**Government efforts should focus on further reducing rural poverty.** This paper shows that there has been a large reduction in rural poverty. In fact, the poverty rate in rural Sudan in 2014/15 was lower than that in urban areas, while it was significantly higher in 2009. As the majority of the population still resides  in  rural  areas,  a  percentage  point  reduction  in  rural  poverty  will  have  a  significantly  larger welfare impact (in terms of the number of households affected) than a percentage point reduction in urban poverty. This necessitates investing in improving agricultural livelihoods in rural Sudan. 

**Increasing farm productivity can be an effective way of reducing poverty, particularly in rural areas where majority of the poor are engaged in agriculture.** The data show a clear relationship between poverty and farm productivity. Though such a link does not imply causation, there are potential channels by which these two metrics are related. Increased farm productivity can increase household income or provide for greater subsistence food consumption, thereby increasing household welfare and reducing poverty. On the other hand, reducing poverty would allow households to invest in activities that may improve productivity. These include investing in agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, diversifying their crop portfolio to include cash crops in the short-term, and investing in human capital to improve productivity in the long-term. 

**Recent evidence suggests that there has been a resurgence in agricultural activity in Sudan as IDPs return (FAO 2019).** Due to improving security and stability in the region of Darfur, previously displaced households have started to return to their homes. For these households to reengage in agricultural activity is seen as a very significant development. However, public authorities need to ensure that these households can make the most of their economic potential, by ensuring that they have access to credit and inputs, and to output markets to sell their surplus produce. Such investments in these previously displaced households will ensure that they do not slip back into a cycle of poverty, which could further breed political instability.  

**Increasing input use, such as the rate of fertilizer and pesticide use, can increase farm productivity and thereby increase economic growth.** Very few farmers, particularly among the poorest households, use such  inputs  to  increase  yields,  even  though  strong  evidence  suggests  that  such  inputs  increase productivity and are generally economically viable (Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson 2008). Public policy initiatives,  such  as  subsidizing  these  inputs,  may  help  increase  the  adoption  of  input-intensive agricultural  practices,  though  such  initiatives  will  only  benefit  those  regions  with  adequate  market infrastructure to supply these inputs to farmers. These tend to be regions where farmers are already using these inputs. Policies that expand market access geographically to regions where existing markets do  not  serve  agrarian  households  will  have  the  largest  impact  on  increasing  smallholder  farm productivity. 

**Novel strategies to increase access to credit can increase farm productivity and profitability.** Public- private partnerships to increase access to credit through microfinance can allow agrarian households to invest in productivity-enhancing inputs or provide the capital needed to transition from subsistence to commercial  farming.  Additionally,  these  reforms  can  be  leveraged  on  existing  and  emerging technologies such as mobile money to enhance financial inclusion and increase efficiency of providing credit to more remote areas where physical banking presence is not feasible. Such services are being pioneered  in  other  African  countries  (Dahir  2019) and  regions  that  share  Sudan’s  low  bank  branch penetration. For some households, especially among the poorest, the opportunity to save and therefore plan for the medium- and long- term may be more attractive than increasing access to credit. Such financial instruments and the savings they allow for make it possible for households to invest in farm productivity when the opportunity arises, or serve as an insurance policy during times of economic hardship.  

**Further  reductions  in  rural  poverty  can  be  made  by  improving  the  non-agrarian  economic opportunities  available  to  rural  Sudanese  households.**  The  findings  suggest  that  nonagricultural households have lower rates of poverty than those solely engaged in farming. However, it is vital that economic policies do not create distortions that artificially inflate the value of nonagricultural work. As is shown in the Appendix, the discussion on the structural change in Sudan shows that Sudan’s economic progress up until 2009 indicates an economy that is not industrial, even though relative agricultural production has fallen. This also indicates an economy with a bloated service and informal urban sectors. Instead, promoting nonagricultural employment tied to the agrarian economy would be most impactful on increasing the welfare of rural households. This can be done by promoting the marketing, storage, and transport of agricultural inputs and outputs, especially in a way that benefits smallholding agrarian households.  

**Creating the infrastructure that makes small-scale businesses viable in rural Sudan is vital to creating a vibrant rural economy.** Such policies will encourage farmers to grow commercially viable crops, or to expand the production of their existing crop from subsistence levels to a level that makes selling in the market  viable.  Connecting  rural  communities  physically,  through  a  robust  transport  network,  and improving  communications  networks  can  greatly  improve  the  livelihoods  of  rural  households. Improvements  to  the  physical  infrastructure  can  facilitate  the  marketing,  storage,  and  transport  of agricultural  inputs  and  outputs  in  an  economically  viable  way,  while  communication  networks  can improve the transfer of information to rural communities. This includes the infrastructure needed to make cell phones and the internet more accessible and useful in the rural areas of Sudan. Improved information will lead to better knowledge of agricultural prices, and a greater ability to develop novel agricultural techniques and grow profitable crop varieties. 

**A robust public farm extension system is vital to providing Sudanese farmers with the know-how to increase agricultural productivity.** As seen in the Appendix, Section II, Sudan’s public extension system employs less than one-tenth of Egypt’s public extension system, for a population more than one-third the size. Extension services can inform farmers on how to make productive and profitable decisions in the face of changing climatic and economic conditions. Such information is vital for ensuring that the poorest agrarian households do not lag behind and can engage successfully and profitably in commercial farming opportunities.**  

**Stagnating innovation in the agricultural sector can be reversed by collaborations between Sudan’s public  agricultural  institutions  and  international  organizations  focused  on  increasing  agricultural productivity.** Such partnerships can promote improved agricultural practices, the introduction of new crop  varieties,  and  the  effective  implementation  of  policies.  Due  to  Sudan’s  recent  international isolation,  the  returns  from  these  partnerships  can  be  considerable.  Cognizant  of  the  diversity  of agroeconomic conditions in Sudan, such partnerships can access and implement proven solutions to impediments faced by farmers to achieving productivity growth.. 

**Expanding  and  repairing  Sudan’s  existing  irrigation  network  can  significantly  increase  farm productivity.**  Currently,  most  agrarian  households  do  not  have  access  to  irrigation.  The  positive correlation between yields and irrigation shows that irrigation can increase productivity. Additionally, farmers  producing  on  irrigated  lands  grow  commercially  viable  crops.  Improved  access  to  irrigation makes farmers less vulnerable to the unpredictable nature of seasonal rains that rain-fed, non-irrigated farming relies upon. Much of Sudan's large irrigation network, on the River Nile in the north of the country  and  its  tributaries  further  south,  was  constructed  during  colonial  times  and  is  in  need  of maintenance and rehabilitation (World Bank 2010). Furthermore, the fact that very few households report having access to irrigation reveals that irrigated lands are owned by a small share of farmers. Ensuring that smallholder farmers also have access to irrigation can lift these farmers out of subsistence farming. Regulation of foreign-owned agricultural operations is vital for ensuring equitable access to Sudan’s rich water resources, while providing employment at these foreign-owned entities to those who need it. 

**Greater  productivity  of  farmers  with  smaller  landholdings  suggests  that  distributive  land  reform policies can increase agrarian productivity.** However, before such policies are enacted, it is important to first identify the reasons for differences in productivity levels. If market failures cause differences in productivity,  addressing  those  market  failures  may  have  greater  rewards  than  implementing  the distributive land reform, which may come at significant political costs. Recent evidence suggests that such  land  reform  can  have  unintended  negative  consequences,  leading  to  reductions  in  overall productivity, as witnessed in the Philippines (Adamopoulos and Restuccia 2015). 

**Policies to increase farm productivity would need to design and implement unique strategies to cater to  Sudan’s  regional  diversity,**  for  example,  regional  differences  stemming  from  agroeconomic differences between irrigated and rain-fed areas, differences between households growing subsistence crops and commercial crops, and differences in land ownership norms. Additionally, regions that are experiencing  conflict  may  have  different  priorities  concerning  agricultural  and  rural  development. Designing unique policies for the disparate and distinct groups of rural Sudanese households will best serve to improve the welfare of the nation. Finally, it is critical to adapt to the threat of climate change through green agriculture.

1. The<a name="_page57_x69.00_y106.00"></a> Structural Gap in Agriculture in Sudan 

**The structural gap in agriculture has been near complete stagnation since the 1970s [(Figure A**.1**)](#_page57_x69.00_y407.00).** The structural gap is the difference between the percentage contribution of agriculture to a nation’s GDP and the proportion of total labor employed in agriculture. For most developing countries, this gap is a negative value because of the relatively low productivity of labor in agriculture, due in part to the large numbers of labor force employed in that sector. As a country develops economically, we expect this gap to reduce. Increased capital intensification due to an expanding manufacturing base leads to decreasing labor intensity in the agricultural sector. Such a pattern of development has been observed in most developed  economies.  In  Sudan,  the  economy  has  not  experienced  such  a  transition,  and  thus  we observe  stagnation in the structural gap. Though both agriculture’s share of total GDP and the share of employment in agriculture have decreased, we do not observe a convergence toward equality between these two values (a movement toward the dotted line in[ Figure A.1)](#_page57_x69.00_y407.00). This illustrates Sudan’s inability to meaningfully increase labor productivity in agriculture and elsewhere in the economy. Though the share of  labor  in  agriculture  has  decreased  in  the  economy,  this  has  not  been  a  result  of  increased employment in the manufacturing sector. It is instead likely to be a result of an increase in the low productivity services sector due to informal urban activities and the marketing of agricultural products (Losch, Fréguin‐Gresh, and White 2011). To achieve sustainable economic growth, Sudan will need to close  the  structural  gap  in  agriculture,  by  increasing  productivity  in  both  the  agricultural  and nonagricultural sectors.

[^3]: The relative rate of assistance (RRA) is calculated using the nominal rate of assistance (NRA) for the agricultural 

    sector and the NRA for the nonagricultural sector, by calculating -  = 100 × [ 100+ . − 1]. The nominal 

    100+ .

    rate of assistance for each sector is computed as the percentage by which government policies have raised gross returns for farmers above what they would be without the government’s intervention (or lowered them if NRA < 

    0). The RRA being below (above) 0, “provides a useful internationally comparable indication of the extent to which a country’s sectoral policy regime has an anti- (pro-) agricultural bias (Kym 2010).”
