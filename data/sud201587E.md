**Sudan E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan (2018-2022)** 

1. **INTRODUCTION:**  

Sudan is endowed with immense natural resources that could constitute a strong springboard for the development of the agriculture sector. It has the largest irrigated area in the continent as well as large herds of livestock, which exceed other large countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as ample lands exploited by rain-fed agricultural systems. However, despite its rich natural resources, the agriculture sector in Sudan has performed poorly in the past decades. 

As  indicated,  in  the  Sudan’s  National  Agriculture  Investment  Plan  (SUDNAIP)  2016-2020,  by  the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) and the sector performance analysis, the agriculture sector suffers from structural problems such as low productivity and high marketing costs that reduce competitiveness and result in lower prices for farmers. This situation has, to a large extent, been caused by volatile and poor economic and sectoral policies as well as by weak institutional capacities. Also, the prevailing distortions in land rights have led to misuse of the land resource and have further exacerbated the low productivity syndrome. Without the above being addressed, it will be extremely difficult to attract full engagement of the private sector and achieve any meaningful sustained growth in the sector. 

The SUDNAIP (2016-2020), as a vehicle, constitutes a renewed opportunity for Sudan to reorient its priorities, to focus on optimizing its scarce resources and to turn agriculture into an engine of growth. To achieve this goal, the SUDNAIP creates investment packages of interrelated interventions that aim to catalyse sector growth through the removal of its structural bottlenecks, thus laying the foundation for subsequent strong private sector-led growth in the future.  

These investments would need to be supported by major institutional reforms, which aim to ensure efficient management of the numerous irrigated schemes, thus avoiding past management mistakes. 

The problems of the agriculture sector in Sudan are often exacerbated by an under-developed agro- industrial sector. Agro-industries increase incomes and employment and can promote industrialization and urban employment, break the productivity gap, reduce food costs and supply uncertainties, improve diets and reduce vulnerability of rural households. They also play a role in improving the balance of payments through either import substitution or the promotion of exports, thus leading to a more stable macroeconomic environment. To add value to agriculture, the SUDNAIP proposes expanding capacities for  selected  agro  processing  products  in  which  Sudan  has  a  comparative  advantage  with  import substitution commodities (sugar, edible oil and milk). 

The private sector is key to the development in the agriculture sector. International, and acquired national experience  clearly  suggests  that  efforts  are  needed  to  remove  barriers  to  productivity  growth, competitiveness and economic integration if the private sector is to play its intended role. Countries in Africa that have improved their investment climates and have invested in removing supply bottlenecks have grown faster and became more competitive. Recognizing and enabling the leading role of the private sector in Sudan will require strategic public investments to address key sector constraints facing the private sector. Consequently, investments in market infrastructure like roads and rail will be given priority.  

These investments will enhance the connectivity of Sudan with its neighbouring African countries and will enable the private sector to benefit from the opportunities created by expanding regional market access which is in line with strategic priorities envisioned by the COMESA, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) etc. These investments will not only generate economic benefits but will also contribute to peace, security and stability in the region. Investments in an enabling environment through policy changes such as the rationalization of taxes and fees, ensuring transparent exchange rates and pricing policies as well as legal and institutional reforms are all required to help unlock private investments. 

The SUDNAIP will translate the strategy into actions by: (i) increasing production and productivity through modernization of the agriculture systems;  (ii) enhancing production by support services and establishing knowledge and information network; (iii) developing marketing infrastructure to increase competitiveness  and  increase  value-addition  through  agro-industrialization  and  value  chain development;  (iv)  protecting  and  conserving  natural  resources  with  a  priority  of  addressing  the agriculture land issue as a key factor in the natural resource management; (v) mainstreaming food and nutrition security and safety; (vi) creating an enabling policy and a legal environment for sustained agriculture growth; and (vii) reforming the institutions and increasing capacities of staff and producers in the agricultural sector. 

SUDNAIP is a five-year investment plan,  which  maps the investments needed to achieve the Sudan Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) target of six % annual growth in Agriculture Domestic Product (GDP). The Sudan will pursue this target through allocating a minimum 10% of its budget to the agricultural sector. The Sudan also seeks the support of the international community and the private sector in bridging the funding gap between the funding requirements and the amount that has already been identified from a variety of domestic, international, public and private sources. 

The SUDNAIP is not a new agricultural development strategy or programme. Rather, it is a sector-wide plan for coordinating and harmonizing the resources needed to accelerate the implementation of existing initiatives and  to  launch  new  initiatives  which  address  national  and  regional  development  priorities  for  sector development. Sudan aims to attain a comprehensive national socio-economic development led by a dynamic agricultural sector capable of rapid and sustainable growth and biased towards the weak and vulnerable sectors of the population and having strong linkage to agricultural industrialization. This vision guides public actions and investments in the sector over the next five years. 

The objectives of the SDNAIP are: 

- Promotion of exports of crops and livestock with a view to safeguarding against the risks of collapse of the whole economy as a result of neglect of the agricultural sector and distortions to agricultural incentives.  
- Increasing productivity and efficiency at the production and processing stages. 
- Realization of food security and nutrition. 
- Reducing rural poverty by 50 % by 2020, generation of job opportunities, especially for youth and women, and increasing per capita income. 
- Achievement of a regionally-balanced sector and economic growth in order to encourage settlement in the rural areas. 
- Development and protection of natural resources to ensure its renewal and sustainability. 

In order to achieve the above objectives, the investment plan is structured under seven Investment Programme Areas (IPAs), each with its own Strategic Objective, major investment programmes, sub programmes and components: 

- IPA1: Enabling Environment for Sustainable Agricultural Development. 
- IPA2: Institutional Reform, Change Management and Enhanced Capacity Building of Producers and Staff in the Agricultural Sector. 
- IPA3:  Increasing  Agricultural  Production  and  Productivity  through  Development  and Modernization of Agricultural Systems and Improved Agricultural Management. 
- IPA4:  Development  of  Agricultural  Support  Services  and  Establishment  of  Knowledge  and Information Network. 
- IPA5: Agricultural Industrialization, Development of Value Chain and Market Access. 
- IPA6: Addressing the Issues of Agricultural Land, Protecting and Developing Natural Resources, including Wildlife. 
- IPA7: Realization of Food Security and Nutrition and Implementation of Quality Control and Safety Measures for Domestic Consumption and Export. 
2. **THE E-AGRICULTURE AND ACTION PLAN**  

The **Sudan E-agriculture Strategy an Action Plan** lays down a roadmap by which ICT developments can significantly contribute towards achievement of the country’s agricultural vision and development objectives.  It integrates standalone ICT experiments under a collaborative and inclusive framework while prioritizing solutions that can be scaled up and supported through the required ecosystem. This document  provides  an  analysis  and  evaluation  of  current  and  prospective  roles  of  Information Communication Technology (ICT) in agriculture in Sudan, lays down a vision for e-agriculture in the country and recommends specific actions plans. The strategy document has been prepared based on the framework guide proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Telecommunication  Union  (ITU),  beside  the  ICT  in  Agriculture:  Connecting  Smallholders  to Knowledge, Networks, and Institutions produced by world bank Group and Others.   

The strategy has been prepared through extensive discussion and stakeholder consultation from multiple sectors and has taken into consideration the fact that ICT would influence people’s life from many different aspects, not only agriculture, and will act as an efficiency multiplier that enables people and processes to achieve higher level of efficiency, effectiveness and enhance the overall quality of life. It leverages on the existing ICT developments that impact agriculture in Sudan and aims to mainstream it.   

E-Agriculture  is  evolving  in  scope  as  new  Information  and  Communication  Technologies  (ICTs) applications continue to be harnessed in the agriculture sector.  It is seen as an emerging field focusing on  the  enhancement  of  agriculture  and  rural  development  through  improved  information  and communication processes.  In this context, ICT is used as an umbrella term encompassing all information and communication technologies including devices, networks, services and applications; these range from innovative Internet-era technologies and sensors to other technologies that have existed for much longer such as telephones, mobiles, television, radio and satellites.  

More specifically, it involves the conceptualization, design, development, evaluation and application of innovative ways to use ICTs in the rural domain, with a primary focus on agriculture and allied fields. Provision  of  standards,  norms,  methodologies,  tools  as  well  as  development  of  individual  and institutional capacities, and policy support are all key components of e- agriculture.  

Access to the right information at the right time through the right medium is crucial for people involved in the agricultural sector. This includes farmers, fishers, foresters, policy makers, industries and other actors in the agricultural value chain. Increasingly, the challenges faced by small holder farmers as a result of climate change, irregular rainfall patterns, attack of pest and the onset of diseases, drought, desertification are detrimental to the agriculture sector’s goals.  

However, opportunities exist through innovative ICT solutions to address a number of these challenges. In recent past, the role that ICTs play in promoting innovation in the agricultural sector has been phenomenal  and  potentially  transformative.  Smallholder  farmers,  particularly  women  and  youth involved in the sector, have a huge advantage when the right ICTs are induced into the agricultural value chain. The access to the right information at the right time gives them the capacity to make informed decisions that would improve their livelihoods, make agri-business more attractive and play a major role in ensuring food security.  

The rapid growth of mobile voice and internet globally provides new avenues to share and access information. In Sudan, there are 29.5. million mobile subscriptions (86%); total tele-density (mobile and fixed) is 34%; 34% internet access in terms of households; and 19.1% broadband in terms of population with the fixed broadband connectivity being 3% while the mobile broadband connectivity comprised a significant 16%.  

Digitization has provided the capability for convergence of these traditional network technologies and the emerging ones (e.g. Machine to Machine (M2M), Internet of Things (IoTs]) using information technology platforms (e.g. mobile apps, data analytics). These networks when combined with data availability, required applications and the right enabling environment, can unleash the tremendous innovation potential of the Sudan agriculture sector.   

The cross-sectoral nature of ICTs propels growth in other sectors that can be further leveraged by the Agriculture sector. Use of data gathering and data analysis by weather department can make micro insurance for the agriculture sector more efficient. The deployment of mobile banking and mobile money by the Telecom and Banking sector can significantly address financial and transactional challenges for the rural communities. The two combined can create a base for providing social safety net for people involved in agriculture sector activities. E-government services too can provide packages of services as well as guidelines critical for e-agriculture growth in the country.   

While in many farming communities people in different farming system of Sudan still rely on feature phones, which offer mainly voice and text services, smartphone access are becoming affordable and their use is increasing. Social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, etc., are becoming services of common use. The rapid growth of broadband, especially mobile broadband provides a great opportunity for the agricultural sector. Also, access to Internet at the telecentres with guided assistance can significantly improve livelihoods and reduce human work intervention to the minimum. With added banking services, the potential is manifold.   

In terms of service capabilities offered by ICTs, new technologies pave the way to advance the services from ‘push’ (e.g. radio, television, SMS) and ‘interactive’ services (e.g. Government to Customer(G2C) services,  interactive  website)  further  on  to  transactional  (e.g.  mobile  payments,  banking  services, payment platforms) and finally connected services. (e.g. a network of sensors and databases integrated over  secure  platforms  monitoring  and  offering  services  on  various  devices  and  providing  timely, accurate and real-time information). Transactional capabilities are the key to linking revenue to services being offered over ICT platforms.  

More specifically, e- agriculture has the potential to meet the agricultural goals of Sudan by contributing in the following areas:  

- Improving national agricultural research systems.  
- Improving National Agricultural Information Systems within the framework of the impact chain.  
- Facilitating trade and domestic market access.  
- Improving agricultural extension and advisory services.  
- Promoting sustainable farming practices.  
- Improving postharvest handling and logistics.  
- Enhancing disaster management and early warning systems.  
- Facilitating financial inclusion, credit, insurance and risk management schemes.  
- Advising policies and monitoring effective implementation.  
- Improving data availability and analysis for food safety and traceability.  
- Enhancing linkage between government, researchers and producers which in turn facilitates effective policies.  
- Improving farmers’ incomes and productivity on a sustainable basis.  
- Enhancing knowledge management and access to information.  
- Improve Forest Governance 
- Using ICT for Remote Sensing, Crowdsourcing, and Big Data to Unlock the Potential of Agricultural Data  
- Using ICT for Land Administration and Management  

The agriculture sector forms the centre stage in the Sudan’s development agenda with about 70% of population engaged in agriculture. It is an essential pillar for rural development. The country also has a vibrant ICT sector with some e-agriculture solutions in place or in pipeline, and is very keen on harnessing its potential. The wide adoption and awareness of ICTs in Sudan not only in agriculture but also in other critical areas such as telecom, banking, e-governance etc. provides transformative potential for agriculture stakeholders to leverage upon. It is also characterized by significant roles played by individuals, public enterprises, private sector, and international development and donor agencies. A vision for ICT deployment in this sector, therefore, needs to build upon the development across multiple sectors while recognizing the varying expectations and roles of different types of stakeholders.  

The ICT in Agriculture (updated version 2016) and the FAO-ITU framework for development of e- agriculture vision entails establishment of an e-agriculture Steering Committee and Task Force;  

- Understanding the national agriculture goals, priorities and challenges;  
- Development of an initial e-agriculture vision;   
- Detailing the e-agriculture outcomes to meet the vision; ![](Aspose.Words.769e33b7-43b6-4d87-a0d7-525a23ffe432.008.png)  
- Analysing the ICT solutions that can realize the outcomes; and ![ref8]  
- Refining and finalizing the e-agriculture vision and outcomes.      

A national approach to e-agriculture developed in an inclusive manner, involving representatives of all critical stakeholders, will ensure that adequate national awareness is raised and that the key stakeholder groups are engaged. In addition, this will also ensure that ICT challenges such as access and use (including costs, applications and quality) posing as hindrances, notably in rural areas and across sectors, are identified and tackled at a higher level in a systematic manner. This would also apply to other sectors critical to agriculture. Such strategic alignment will result in better sustainability of solutions, cost- effectiveness and their wider adoption.   

A national approach will also help improve the coordinated planning and funding of e-agriculture solutions/service development, avoid duplication and the waste of resources. ICT for agriculture projects are sometimes duplicated in different ministries, agencies as well as service providers targeting the same stakeholders. Systematic effort in planning and setting up a national e-agriculture approach allows for a streamlining of government efforts, ensuring the judicious use of scarce resources while providing a clear direction to the private sector, donors and other stakeholders.   

Furthermore, the process of developing a national e-agriculture approach may reveal the need for related institutional changes or adjustments and instituting an ICT interoperability framework leading to an enabling regulatory environment for the deployment, adoption or integration of innovative technologies. The elaboration of such an approach offers the opportunity not only to raise awareness but also to clarify the main components and potential benefits of e-agriculture for the vast majority of stakeholders and their role in realizing that potential.    

The work on e-agriculture strategy started in 2014, where initial issues and challenges were identified. In August 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Collaboration with FAO RNE Office and support from National Information Centre and National Telecommunications Corporation organized a one-day expert workshop to lunch the work of development of the National E-agriculture Strategy. In October 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Collaboration with FAO and CARDNE organized a three-day experts workshop on the “role of ICT in Agriculture: current and future prospects”. The two workshops and series of meetings done by the e-agriculture governance framework in Sudan that been established comprised of a Leadership Committee, a Steering Committee and a Task Force, discuss issues related to lesson learned, succeed stories and good practice e-solutions in agricultural and rural  development,  food  security,  value  chains,  markets  and  marketing,  finance  that  related  to development of the National E-agriculture Strategy.   

These Key stakeholders, from the policy makers, public and private sectors,  identified issues and challenges pertaining to the agriculture sector in  Sudan and the result of the brainstorming, were identified under these following 8 categories:  

- Policies, guidelines and regulatory frameworks  
- Resource constraints  
- Value chain, farm inputs and logistics  
- Natural resource management and climate change  
- Marketing and financing  
- Data availability, accessibility and reliability  
- Knowledge, information and awareness  
- Lack of services

4. **POROPSED AND EXISTING E-SOLUTIONS** 

` `E-agriculture  Strategy  would  be  built  on  the  existing  solutions  developed  through  Field/Regular Programs/Projects. Some of the potential applications of ICTs that could be considered to improve existing agriculture system information collection, efficiencies and services in Sudan include:  

- **Mobile based integrated agriculture advisory service:** An** integrated ICT approach is required to streamline and strengthen agriculture extension and advisory services including call centers, SMS 

service (push and pull), field problems diagnostic tools, field visits of extension staff, experts’ consultancies and progress monitoring.   ￿  **Food crop forecasting and marketing information service:** Real time information system for cultivation extent and yield forecasting is an urgent need to monitor the progress of National Food Crop Production Program. This information is also important to strengthen the value chain in 

agriculture to avoid over production or scarcity of food crop production in the country.  

- **Pesticide registration and pesticide information e-service**: Registration, marketing and use of pesticides are governed by the Pesticide Registration Act and implemented by the Office of Registrar of Pesticides of the DOA. Pesticide testing and registration process can be monitored through an 

information system, which may increase awareness to pesticide companies, administrators and policy makers. Pesticide recommendations with relevant information can be transferred through an e-service.    ￿  **Plant protection e-service:** Pest and disease diagnostic tools can be introduced as mobile and web based  applications.  This  may  reduce  the  over  use  of  pesticides  and  promote  Integrated  Pest 

Management Methodologies.   ￿  **Research information management system**: Agriculture Research Corporation Policy compiles information  collected  from  research  institutions,  but  there  is  a  need  to  establish  full-fledged 

information system that enables research information to be shared among scientist and provides an access to online repository.  ￿  **Soil test results e-service**: Agricultural stations provide soil-testing facilities to farmers. All results are given manually and processes can’t be monitored. Web based and mobile based information 

system can provide e-service for soil testing results as well as enable tracking progress.  ￿  **E-agriculture library service:**  IMMCDs, video on demand, bibliography service will be effective through an IT solution. E-learning mechanism could also be introduced through this system.   ￿  **Natural resources management information services:** Natural resource management centre of the Ministry will implements Soil Conservation Act and Regulations. Access to e-applications and e-

reports related to the regulations should be available online. Access to soil and weather information for different agro climatic zones can also be made possible through IT solution.    

- **Plant genetic resources information service:** Ministry has one of most important plant genetic resource centre and information related to conservation could be made available online.   
- **Agriculture diploma students’ information system:** Ministry will conduct agriculture diploma course at agriculture schools, which can be made available online to students**.** At the same time, e**-**

  learning mechanism could be introduced to strengthen the agriculture education in the country**.**  

- **Plant  quarantine  e-service:**  National  Plant  Quarantine  Service  (NPQS)  of  the  Ministry  is authorized to implement plant quarantine regulations under the Plant Protection Act. The plant 

  quarantine offices have been located at the major seaport and airports. Imports and exports at those locations are under control of the Custom Authority which plans to introduce a single window platform. NPQS involves in issuing phytosanitary certificates to exporters as well as for searching pest and disease risk in importing agriculture living material. There is a need for an information system to monitor all plant quarantine activities at the seaport and airport.   

- **Weather forecasting and advisory service:** As climate change has adversely affected agriculture sector, daily weather forecasting and advisory service (especially location specific services) will be 

very useful to farmers. Such a system could be implemented as a joint program of the Natural Resource Management Centre of the DOA and the Meteorological Department.   ￿  **Land use and soil conservation mapping and e-information system:** Land development and soil conservation has been identified as crucial factors of agriculture in the country and such information system may help all stakeholders in agriculture in improving the land information and use.   ￿  **Geo-spatial information service**: Establishment of geo-spatial information service will help the Department of Agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture and other stakeholders, to take correct 

decisions based on real time information. It would also empower the current crop insurance scheme.  ￿  **Farm Machinery e-information service:** Farm mechanization is a high priority in accordance with the present National Food Production Program.  Proper ICT solution may increase the production, 

distribution and use of farm machineries.

The Sudan E-agriculture Strategy and Action Plan was built on SUDNAIP 2016-2020 and follow the same process aiming at harnessing the ICT potential of Sudan in achieving its agricultural goals. This strategy was developed following the framework proposed by the FAO-ITU E-agriculture Strategy Guide.  

The E-agriculture governance framework in Sudan was established to comprise of National ICT Steering Committee, National ICT Technical Committee and Task Force to admin the Ministry of Agriculture network **(*moaf.gov.sd*)** and e-agriculture Portal **(*e-agriculture.sd*)**. 

An e-agriculture task force was set up in Sudan comprising of members from various departments of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Telecommunications Corporation Commission of Sudan. Other critical stakeholders from Departments of Ministry of Agriculture, Information and Communication Centre were also consulted during the process. Technical assistance was provided by the FAO office in Sudan together with the FAO RNE and ITU Regional office in the development of this strategy.  

5. **SUDAN E-AGRICULTURE VISION**  

Innovations in ICT is happening at a very fast pace and this document has captured the effects of future disruptive technologies and recommends roadmap for adoption and evolution of current ICT initiatives, to be relevant and useful in future. The cross-sectoral nature of agriculture as well as ICTs requires formal mechanisms for collaboration amongst critical stakeholders. A leadership committee, steering committee and task force structure team has been established to guide the implementation.  

ICTs  form  an  important  pillar  to  address  agricultural  challenges  and  facilitate  meeting  national agricultural goals. As a first step, developing an e-agriculture vision would provide a strategic direction to the desired outcomes. E-solutions can then be adopted to achieve these outcomes.   

Recognizing the transformative potential of ICTs in the agriculture sector, the e-agriculture vision for Sudan is **aims to address the challenges and in doing so envision achieving** ***“Excellence in adopting e-solutions to transform agriculture for national prosperity capable of rapid and sustainable growth, inclusive of smallholders and with strong linkages to agricultural industrialization.”*** 

Although the adoption of e-solutions is an ongoing activity, the current ***action plans*** are set for*** a timeline of **2022**. The vision embodies the strategy to accelerate the growth of the agriculture sector, increase production and reduce imports, reduce the demand and supply gap of food produce and consumption, improve the quality and safety of food and improve livelihoods more effectively. The expected outcomes are detailed in the subsequent section.

11. **E-AGRICULTURE BUDGET 2018-2022** 

The costing and budgeting for the e-agriculture programme action plan areas was undertaken drawing on current and past realities of the Sudan. Financing and the speed of implementation of the e-agriculture action plan programme areas are evidence based, thus planned to avoid unrealistic expectations. This is critical given current resources constraints which are in turn related to some of the challenges facing Sudan that limit its ability to raise substantial revenues or have access to large foreign investment funding. 

Following the identification of the Nine Programme Areas (IPAs) that will constitute the Action Plan strategic intervention, these IPAs will be divided into sub programs, and in turn the sub programs to be divided into components. For each component, specific quantitative output targets to be identified. The budget  of  the  Action  Plan  will  base  on  multiplying  the  targeted  quantitative  output  of  each  sub component by the unit cost of each quantitative target to derive the total cost of the components and subsequently the total cost of the ICT programme areas below: 

- ICT Programme Area 1: Increase the availability and accuracy of agricultural information by creating, updating, analyzing and linking critical databases; 
- ICT Programme Area 2: Accessible, affordable and secure ICT platforms, networks and devices with enhanced sensing, hosting, analytical, identification, tracking and communicating features; 
- ICT  Programme  Areas  3:  Improve  the  awareness,  education  and  skills  of  farmers,  extension workers,  livestock  herders  and  other  sector  end-users  by  creating  and  disseminating  credible agricultural knowledge remotely;  
- ICT Programme Areas 4: Reduce the demand-supply gap, and enhance outreach and profitability of Sudan products and services through vibrant e-agriculture market places and efficient logistics;  
- ICT Programme Areas 5: Improve the research capability, quality, credibility and reach of extension advisory using ICTs;  
- ICT Programme Areas 6: Promote innovation in e-agriculture services;  
- ICT Programme Areas 7: Reduce the individual risks of agriculture sector stakeholders; 
- ICT Programme Areas 8: Improve the financing, investing and banking outreach to agriculture sector leveraging on electronic and mobile technologies;  
- ICT Programme Areas 9: Improve the existing framework of policies, legislations, regulations and guidelines critical for e-agriculture and ensure its effective implementation; 

However, it is clear that finance resources, if carefully planned, could yield more benefits if correctly allocated and administered. One of the areas that require special attention is ICT funding, through the E-Agriculture and Action Plan, to individual states. To ensure the commitment of the 18 States to the action plan process is challenging given the autonomous nature of managing their jurisdictions as stipulated in the Interim National Constitution. It is planned to enrich the development dialogue between the Federal Government and the States, thus ensuring an optimal use of the funds planned under the ICT in agriculture. The government will consider innovative options as an incentive for directing states funds into the action plan priorities. The modalities, areas and operationalisation of these options, as well as the required policy reform for implementation will be one of the action plan studies as part of the enabling environment required. Innovative financial mechanisms for investment will draw on similar experiences and success stories. 

The total agriculture investment requirements for the next five years (2018-2022) are estimated at US$ 110 million (with average requirements of about US$ 22 million per year). To ensure conformity with the absorptive capacity in the agriculture sector will start with 20% of total annually.

12. **INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION** 

The issue of ICT Action Plan implementation to be place the under the under the Minister of Agriculture with a semi-autonomous sand Forests. The basic premise is that no new institutions will be created for the implementation; rather existing institutions will be used. The implementation of the projects and programs will be the responsibility of the respected ministries and agencies and the states as stipulated in  the  constitutional  powers  of  both  the  federal  government  and  the  states  and  the  subsequent Presidential Decrees stating the jurisdictions of the respective government organs.  

However,  the  ICT  Unit  within  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Forests  will  be  responsible  for coordination and monitoring. The main task of the Unit will be to: (i) Collect necessary information related  to  the  implementation  from  the  respective  bodies  and  ensure  consistency  between  the government budgets, and policies with the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan commitments, (ii) Establish a M&E system to get feedback for the Steering Committee on progress of the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan implementation, (iii) Alert the steering Committee on challenges and policy requirements to correct deviations, (iv) Ensure that there is adequate coordination at the policy and projects identification level. 

The Unit will have a small core staff with specially designed incentive system, and will establish a strong M&E system to track implementation of the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan. 

The involvement of several Government agencies and non-government parties necessitated by the broad range of interventions in the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan requires coordinated decisions. The Unit  will  be  overseen  by  a  Steering  Committee.  The  government  will  take  the  lead  in  the implementation; however, it will not shoulder this responsibility alone. Major stakeholders, namely the private sector and the farmers representatives will be represented in the Steering Committee. 

To ensure coordination at the operational side, the Steering Committee will be at the Undersecretaries level and will meet quarterly to review the progress. The Unit will act as the secretariat for the Steering Committee. 

The Major tasks of the steering Committee will be:  

- enhancing coherence and alignment of current and planned activities within all the programs, projects and plans 
- identifying development and priorities and gaps 
- promoting an enabling environment (policies) and partnerships for the effective implementation of the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan 
- Overseeing the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan implementation and Monitoring process 

Political support for the process will be obtained at the Council of Ministers level. The Chairman of the Steering Committee (the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry) can report directly to the Minister of Agriculture on progress and issues related to the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan and the Minister will in turn report to the Council of Ministers.  

Another avenue of reporting could be done by the chairman of the Steering Committee to the Economic Technical Committee of the Council of Ministers (The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Agriculture is a member in the Economic Technical Committee). The Economic Technical Committee reports to the Economic  Ministerial  Committee  (The  Minister  of  Agriculture  and  Forestry  is  a  member  in  the Economic Ministerial Committee) which is one of the organs of the Cabinet. 

13. **MONITORING AND EVALUATION FOR E-AGRICULTURE STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN (2018 -2022)** 

The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System will be result-based and will constitute an integral component of the knowledge management and innovation mainstreaming activities of the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan.  

The system is results-based, focusing mainly on the outputs, outcomes and impacts for the specified nine ICT programme areas, and will be employed to track, monitor and evaluate the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan performance.  

Also, the M&E System will monitor input deliveries, understand, facilitate and strengthen the existing M&E systems in the different projects, programmes and institutions. It will identify the right indicators that will ideally serve the planned objectives.  

The crucial starting step will be setting and assigning the baseline indicators. While some indicators are readily available, others may need to be generated from surveys or through research and consultations with concerned organizations.  

On the other hand, the end and annual targets will be derived from the strategic objectives of the various ICT programme areas. The baselines and targets will be the main focus for progress reporting. 

The overriding goal of the M&E is to assist in the realization of the impact of the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan. It is also important in ensuring that the interventions produce resilient and sustainable results. The system should effectively contribute to the following:  

- Decision-making, which may be linked to interventions at all levels of the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan. This includes macro-level decisions related to policies that cut across sectors and affect the overall development process; 
- Accountability  which  provides  critical  assessments  that  demonstrate  whether  or  not  the interventions satisfy the target groups’ needs and priorities. It should help to establish substantive accountability by generating answers to some critical questions regarding the achievements of E- Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan. 
- Learning, sharing and knowledge management with the purpose of improving the overall quality of 

  the ongoing and future interventions.  

The system will report on the status of achievement of the objectives and annual targets during the five- year  plan  period  at  national  and  state levels. The M&E  system  will  incorporate  the formulation, monitoring  and  evaluation  plan,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  systematic framework  and  a results framework. The M&E system will coordinate and streamline the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan M&E activities at the state level.  

A major objective of the E-Agriculture Strategy and Action Plan M&E system is to track the flows of the implemented projects and programmes out of the overall plan. The reports will be on 3-monthly bases all throughout the live span of the plan. 

The  E-Agriculture  Strategy  and  Action  Plan  M&E  will  assist  the  implementation  of  the  M&E Framework and will be the essential basis for the results framework. The M&E Plan will be updated for the actual requirements. Periodic monitoring missions will be organised as needed and an annual review will be conducted with the involvement of all stakeholders. 

The e-agriculture monitoring framework includes monitoring of *outcomes* and *solutions* (*outputs*) for all ICT Programmatic Areas*.* A detailed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan would need to be developed after adoption of the strategy for the expected outcomes and the action plan for each phase. 

14. **WAY FORWARD**  

A Special focus would be given to MOAF partnership with NIC, NTC and ITU in E-Agriculture Strategy and E-Solution and Action Plan preparation, endorsement and implementation through Memorandum of Understanding. 

NTC/ITU representative agreed to partnership and work closely with NIC, MOAF and FAO on the development of E-Agriculture Strategy and e-solutions for strategic implementation of ICT solutions for agriculture using ITU initiatives and tools. MOAF, NIC, NTC, ITU and FAO should officially endorse it to ensure their support and sustainability in the implementation phases.  

The successful implementation of E-Agriculture strategy and solutions will depend on many diverse stakeholders  and  all  participating  organizations  being  committed  and  mutually  accountable  for achieving results.
